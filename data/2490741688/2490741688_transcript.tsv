00:00:00.000	 You
00:00:30.000	 I
00:00:42.000	 Hey chat
00:00:54.720	 Notifications off. What does that mean?
00:01:00.000	 You
00:01:14.000	 New whistle top tag dropped
00:01:16.000	 I
00:01:28.000	 Saw a little bit of it
00:01:30.000	 It looks ridiculously insanely hard
00:01:34.000	 It looks so hard. It can't possibly be fun. I think she's just trying to squeak when it's right
00:01:52.000	 But
00:02:00.000	 the
00:02:05.440	 show the dog I don't think she wants to be shown
00:02:10.000	 think it over here yeah she doesn't want to be shown
00:02:16.000	 so I'd like to do time trials and other stuff but I haven't played in a while so
00:02:31.680	 let's just do some fucking races for a little bit of a storm up
00:02:35.360	 I know we probably won't win on any tracks that I have in time trial but
00:02:48.960	 I'll be lucky
00:02:58.960	 I like this bike
00:03:06.960	 what I'm gonna start doing I know that I wanted to just do one time trial a day
00:03:11.360	 I haven't been able to play in a little bit which is kind of annoying
00:03:14.960	 although yesterday I totally could play it and we didn't
00:03:18.960	 so I guess it's not a pretty fair assessment but I'd like to do like a
00:03:26.640	 handful of time trials a day to a low level just so that I can understand the
00:03:31.440	 way that the track has meant to be played and maybe like see a couple of
00:03:35.040	 side paths that are good that people use
00:03:43.040	 am I better on you too? I play better on you too
00:03:51.040	 because we cut all the parts where I suck at let's just funny
00:03:57.040	 Jack the big boy things we said
00:04:00.000	 is that are in the park as well
00:04:03.000	 you're subredact hot you play a deluxe the other day
00:04:11.000	 I haven't played a deluxe since this game came out I played it
00:04:15.000	 someone was telling me that they saw me playing twos the kingdom that's not me
00:04:19.000	 I haven't played twos the kingdom and like forever
00:04:23.000	 I haven't played it I played a deluxe probably like ten days before this game came out
00:04:32.000	 and I was digging and I like it I still think I could do it again
00:04:36.000	 Holy shit how can I not play this race yet
00:04:54.000	 This game is like jets at radio or like Tony Hawk Trosket or racing
00:05:01.000	 like the shit you can do this game is so weird I can't believe this
00:05:05.000	 like they actually went this route they like smash melee this game without meaning to
00:05:11.000	 like this shit is so like high potential hardcore like weird with the fucking wall riding
00:05:19.000	 like if they actually made maps and I mean some of the time-traum maps are
00:05:24.000	 but like when you play knockout and all the tracks are just like straight lines
00:05:28.000	 like most of the time you can't do any crazy cuts
00:05:31.000	 but like if the maps were like really condense with tons of rams and shit
00:05:34.000	 it's like you'd be able to do such crazy shit constantly
00:05:37.000	 because there's no cool down to like any of the wall jumps you can do
00:05:41.000	 there's no way they meant to I bet they nerfed and they make it so like when you're
00:05:50.000	 grinding like one person at the time you just slip in like place plan
00:05:54.000	 that sounds like something to do
00:06:00.000	 Well, I can't believe the game will let me race.
00:06:03.500	 What the fuck have been here for like five minutes?
00:06:07.000	 I haven't seen an Nintendo direction like forever.
00:06:15.000	 I'm already excited for Donkey Kong, you know, so I don't really feel like I need to watch you directly.
00:06:21.000	 Wistletop has some tech that's so advanced, saves so much time and is so annoying.
00:06:35.000	 That you're pretty much a pussy if you don't try and just do it, but the amount of enjoyment and pain,
00:06:46.000	 you're going to get basically no enjoyment grinding it out.
00:06:48.000	 It's going to be extremely painful and you're probably like never going to have a run, never going to have a run,
00:06:55.000	 you're going to have some runs where you hit the trick and then fuck up the easy stuff and it's going to feel like crap.
00:07:01.000	 And then eventually you'll pee pee.
00:07:04.000	 And it'll feel good, but man dude, ah, Jesus Christ.
00:07:10.000	 I'm sure Tyler will get it.
00:07:16.000	 There's a difference though.
00:07:24.000	 Like, for instance, Super R64 is fun to run because there's not some like insane, really low percentage trick.
00:07:35.000	 At least in like some of us, I guess be it like lobby BLJ, but I know some like people that got really good at lobby BLJ and control compares.
00:07:45.000	 It's not that far.
00:07:47.000	 So I've been told, I suck that out.
00:07:58.000	 The difference would be like the comparison.
00:08:00.000	 It's like, I agree it's time.
00:08:01.600	 It's like, I agree it's time to just have some tricks
00:08:02.880	 where it's like, you gotta hit it
00:08:04.720	 if you miss it, you lose so much time
00:08:06.720	 that you run this just to be back in the dead.
00:08:08.960	 It's like, there's no coming back from it.
00:08:12.720	 I have less fun speed running games like that.
00:08:15.440	 If there's just like one really hard,
00:08:17.440	 though percentage trick that you just have to hit.
00:08:21.040	 It's more fun when it's like, just overall movement.
00:08:26.240	 That looks cool.
00:08:30.000	 There's a trade off, though, because a lot of the time if you're trying to hit like one trick,
00:08:45.600	 that decides like everything, the nice thing about that is,
00:08:50.000	 it looks really cool all the time.
00:08:53.040	 And if she looks cool, you know what?
00:09:00.080	 Cover's up for a long.
00:09:13.520	 I think he'll catch one first.
00:09:30.080	 There we go.
00:09:34.080	 You mother fucker.
00:09:44.560	 I'm trying to win.
00:09:49.520	 No protection.
00:09:52.160	 I should have saved it.
00:09:56.800	 I didn't think he was hurt already.
00:10:00.000	 and
00:10:10.000	 you need a choice on every map he won races
00:10:13.000	 yeah, I do feel
00:10:15.000	 one
00:10:44.000	 a lot of you could they're just joining off my friends list
00:10:49.000	 I'm too lazy to add people right now but if you are very persistent
00:10:55.000	 or you just figure out a way to add me
00:10:58.000	 I'll probably add you back next time I go to add people
00:11:05.000	 what's your name
00:11:14.000	 the most I'm going to do with whistle-top is try and like
00:11:19.000	 either one play it today or all try and like basically save state
00:11:25.000	 attempt the new trick just to see what it's like but probably not do runs
00:11:35.000	 if I in front of you it's because you either were I thought that you didn't have a switch to
00:11:45.000	 yeah there's some new trick it seems like a second
00:11:54.000	 then 10 or even up I don't know how to do this if we're just gonna race
00:12:00.000	 the
00:12:10.180	 the
00:12:33.600	 to
00:13:02.560	 to this part, it feels like you're going like 200cc or something.
00:13:16.760	 But actually when this, this will be so lucky because there hasn't been like a blue shell
00:13:19.960	 or anything.
00:13:24.960	 Maybe everyone's trying to do like the really hard tricks that they suck so if you
00:13:32.520	 can.
00:13:39.520	 Uh-oh.
00:13:44.580	 These have a night of two.
00:13:53.920	 Easy tried to do the trick and I think might have failed.
00:14:00.000	 I'm gonna be so sad I don't at least get like top two
00:14:30.000	 there was not a single blue shell that whole race
00:14:41.000	 damn you got a lot better you know what's crazy I didn't at all not at all nothing
00:14:46.720	 fucking changed I just didn't get hit by a blue shell that's it nothing I haven't
00:14:53.840	 practiced at all and that track doesn't have some crazy super bullshit skip that
00:14:58.740	 anyone in this lobby was capable of hitting Dylan is a villain thanks for
00:15:07.940	 so
00:15:18.740	 cap you've been sweating offline I haven't I haven't I wasn't able to play for a
00:15:27.060	 couple days and I was able to play a string because I got shown an MMO called a
00:15:31.700	 Pugia to start playing a little bit lucky monkey thanks to the sub I didn't
00:15:45.940	 play Mario Kart 8 though like I swear I don't understand it's like someone's
00:15:50.180	 impersonating me and for something I like I don't know how to show it but I
00:15:58.980	 I seriously haven't
00:16:00.000	 I don't have it installed on my Switch 2.
00:16:05.000	 I tried rematch and I think it's fun.
00:16:08.000	 I like it a lot but I know that the friends that I have to play with would probably be like Mango's chat and Mango's chat is going to fucking know life this shit out of that game and I'm not.
00:16:21.000	 Plus it's kind of annoying playing those kind of games where you don't have like a set group where it's like your spots always there.
00:16:27.000	 I don't want to be in a group.
00:16:29.000	 Not that they're not like nice guys or anything but I don't want to feel like my spot is taking up the spot from someone else.
00:16:36.000	 If they really don't play because I don't really want to play that bad.
00:16:40.000	 So...
00:16:48.000	 I'm starting shooting.
00:16:51.000	 I'm not really sure.
00:16:56.000	 I play it like an hour you larp is a playmaker.
00:16:59.000	 I wouldn't need a larp due I am a playmaker.
00:17:03.000	 Oh shit.
00:17:13.000	 What the fuck?
00:17:14.000	 I thought you had a mushroom where that came from.
00:17:21.000	 at least it's one of these tracks where it doesn't really matter what happens until you get
00:17:27.480	 to the point.
00:17:28.480	 Did we get the end?
00:17:30.480	 The hammer, girl.
00:17:40.480	 They should make this game so you have to play in the open world the unlocked parts for your
00:17:44.200	 car.
00:17:51.560	 And if you don't want to do that, you have to buy a bunch of them new bows that are shaped
00:17:54.840	 like cart parts.
00:18:00.000	 They'll call it Mario Kart, not even anything else, because we're reimagining the series
00:18:15.280	 and all other Mario Kart's their shit.
00:18:20.000	 And that way we can confuse consumers.
00:18:31.000	 I almost have maximum things.
00:18:35.000	 Oh, yeah.
00:18:44.000	 Once I get around the sternum, pop on this pool of bitch.
00:18:47.000	 Come on, no one lightning, please pop it.
00:18:54.000	 That was the shortest, shittiest bullet bill of my entire life.
00:19:00.000	 I'm embarrassed.
00:19:10.000	 I could have defended myself, but this is a tight turn.
00:19:22.000	 Dude, if you just don't hit me with that, I come in first.
00:19:26.000	 Who the fuck did that?
00:19:28.000	 All that had to have was I don't get hit by that, and I can take the shortcuts to win.
00:19:34.000	 What the fuck?
00:19:38.000	 That would have been satisfying.
00:19:41.000	 Jesus Christ, that was ridiculous timing.
00:19:46.000	 Is the room full?
00:19:47.000	 I don't think so.
00:19:49.000	 Not sure.
00:19:58.000	 Couldn't even hit me in a way so that I could like.
00:20:00.000	 make the jump.
00:20:02.000	 Damn it.
00:20:04.000	 I like this part a lot.
00:20:09.000	 I like bikes in this game too.
00:20:14.000	 I don't understand why you would choose to use a card in this game.
00:20:18.000	 I don't know if it's the stats for the same.
00:20:20.000	 Although maybe there's like small differences I don't know.
00:20:30.000	 I need you to go back to back.
00:20:38.000	 I'm probably not going to go back to back.
00:20:40.000	 I'm especially not going to go back to back.
00:20:43.000	 If there's probably like a handful of people that could join that would make it so I never
00:20:49.000	 would not go back to back.
00:20:50.000	 I'd have to like time trial some shit or get extremely lucky with maps come out.
00:20:56.000	 Like if Mooney joins I'm fucked.
00:20:58.000	 I'm not going to win sooner.
00:21:06.000	 Kim would probably also mess me up but I don't know if they're playing that much right now.
00:21:10.000	 Yeah, I'm going to time trial multiple maps.
00:21:16.000	 I just haven't played in like three days I think.
00:21:20.000	 So I just wanted to do some regular races just to fuck around the world.
00:21:24.000	 That's not fine.
00:21:26.000	 I'm not going to bang my head against the wall with whistle top.
00:21:30.000	 I'm going to probably just learn like I don't know.
00:21:36.000	 I don't know.
00:21:38.000	 Something.
00:21:40.000	 Something that.
00:21:42.000	 Shit.
00:22:00.000	 it was as I get
00:22:05.000	 at bumming
00:22:10.000	 that I miss sick
00:22:13.000	 it's all right, we got time
00:22:16.000	 and I'm got off with sand agon
00:22:27.000	 and I'm just where I can cut a corner
00:22:31.000	 but
00:22:46.000	 I need to get away from all the fucking
00:22:48.000	 randoms, oh my god
00:22:51.000	 I'm like he backed up with that bomb
00:23:02.000	 I didn't even want to look back because I was like I can't really change my movement that much
00:23:07.000	 and I'm pretty sure it's gonna be back
00:23:10.000	 I love
00:23:12.000	 I'm
00:23:19.000	 whoo
00:23:22.000	 whoo
00:23:30.000	 where's the fucking items
00:23:37.000	 I didn't think I was gonna go
00:23:38.000	 someone gonna hit me, I'm 1,000% sure
00:23:42.000	 see I told you I fucking told you
00:23:45.000	 these goddamn stream snipers
00:23:48.000	 please don't hit me, please don't hit me
00:23:53.000	 I'll take it
00:24:00.000	 big boy Ronald thanks to sub.
00:24:07.000	 Well I'm getting some e-Lo back.
00:24:13.000	 That's good.
00:24:15.000	 It's up to you see.
00:24:17.000	 No one is sniping you.
00:24:19.000	 I hate to break it to you but this entire lobby is basically full of people from my
00:24:23.000	 Fred's list.
00:24:26.000	 That guy who ran into me obviously is not directly streamed, but he kind of is.
00:24:36.000	 I can't play with brawl every time I stream.
00:24:41.000	 You don't think gamer girl is sniping me a com-a.
00:24:44.000	 She's sniping.
00:24:47.000	 So you added them, it doesn't matter.
00:24:50.000	 But I can still complain about it.
00:24:53.000	 You can't tell me what not to complain about.
00:25:01.000	 This guy picks DK's space port.
00:25:04.000	 My most hated map, any picks the long version of it.
00:25:09.000	 What a psycho.
00:25:22.000	 I'm trying to see if I can wall jump.
00:25:30.000	 The tiny cards.
00:25:31.000	 I don't think I can jump on top of them.
00:25:43.000	 I love everyone just picks a random now nice fucking game.
00:25:47.000	 Yeah.
00:25:52.000	 At least there's an option.
00:26:00.000	 but you're right it is pretty fucking stupid that was pretty
00:26:10.180	 the
00:26:26.360	 I don't think so.
00:26:36.360	 Sorry dude.
00:26:53.360	 turn
00:27:11.920	 the only guy that's not a stream sniper is the Japanese guy and even he's still
00:27:16.480	 not sure
00:27:28.880	 you can do it trickling jump out of the line
00:27:35.440	 it's pretty good to get lightning here
00:27:46.480	 that was not faster
00:28:00.000	 I was trying something new.
00:28:14.000	 It's height line.
00:28:17.000	 Oh my god, that works so well.
00:28:21.000	 Where did this guy come from? This guy knows some shortcut I don't.
00:28:31.000	 That helps.
00:28:35.000	 Oh man, do that guy's in such a good spot.
00:28:38.000	 You can just cut here, man.
00:28:53.000	 I needed a mushroom.
00:29:01.000	 I needed a sandbag there.
00:29:04.000	 We weren't far enough ahead.
00:29:09.000	 Oh well.
00:29:30.000	 What should you eat for dinner?
00:29:37.000	 You guys hear that?
00:29:50.000	 I don't know Blades.
00:30:00.000	 that's my dog laughing
00:30:12.000	 you know I have a friend who skins their graves before they eat them
00:30:18.000	 you're a psycho if you do that
00:30:28.000	 there's something going on
00:30:34.000	 it's a big getty to you thanks for sub to see things for sub
00:30:43.000	 and
00:30:50.000	 now it's not me
00:30:53.000	 I need graves that often
00:30:59.000	 I
00:31:23.000	 I should have just used those. I don't know what I was thinking.
00:31:36.200	 Dude, I hate this map.
00:31:39.240	 This is a map I should time trial.
00:31:43.560	 I'm sure I've right into that shit so I can't really complain.
00:31:46.040	 I hate to get some coins and hope.
00:31:57.080	 This is a good sandbag now.
00:32:00.000	 I
00:32:11.520	 The thing is like I can't even tell when this ends I'm like look at the map. It's just a bunch of jambles and lines
00:32:22.000	 I mean some of the protects me
00:32:30.000	 I
00:32:48.000	 I shot my load too early man
00:32:52.000	 Damn it
00:32:54.000	 I need to be protection until the very end
00:33:00.000	 I'm losing all my elo again
00:33:16.000	 I just don't know these tracks some of the tracks that I don't know it's like
00:33:24.000	 I don't know there's the difference between like race on the track a couple times and
00:33:27.200	 time-trailing it
00:33:31.200	 I'm sure there's like weird stuff you can do to save a little bit
00:33:35.200	 Plus one thing that's kind of confusing about some of these tracks is
00:33:39.200	 There is slightly different if you play them in like the three lap mode and
00:33:45.200	 If you just pick the map straight up, so like you do like a travel into the map
00:33:57.200	 Like I didn't recognize that final turn will not the final turn
00:34:00.000	 It was like the turn in the water.
00:34:01.400	 Like the final turn in the water.
00:34:02.680	 I didn't recognize how it's tight that was gonna be.
00:34:04.440	 If I took that turn tighter,
00:34:07.320	 maybe I would've been far ahead enough
00:34:08.640	 where I wouldn't have been hit by the Blue Ring
00:34:10.000	 and then I would've got like a top four top five.
00:34:12.120	 Just a bit.
00:34:14.960	 Oh, no.
00:34:19.800	 It could be really small noise.
00:34:21.360	 I'm just gonna go ahead and get the Blue Ring.
00:34:28.360	 Jerome Derry, Colin. Thank you so much.
00:34:36.840	 I'll do a couple more races and then I'll just pick some random track.
00:34:40.640	 I'm probably gonna do time trial on that DK space format
00:34:43.520	 that I really don't like.
00:35:22.040	 I like this map.
00:35:45.480	 I didn't really want to go big until I was on the ground
00:35:47.720	 because I don't think it really gives you much of a speed boost in the air.
00:35:50.280	 I'm like most of the time you don't get hit by anyways.
00:35:55.280	 If you actually use it though, be a visitor item to learn.
00:35:57.280	 Let's see other things like...
00:35:59.280	 If I could...
00:36:00.000	 remember exactly where the item boxes were?
00:36:03.000	 that'd be such an advantage.
00:36:18.000	 I think I am the only guy.
00:36:30.000	 I think I'm the only guy who's been here.
00:36:34.000	 Did it start me here like every fucking dead?
00:36:37.000	 It's weird.
00:36:51.000	 Dude, I've been hit by a red shell every single time I've taken that turn.
00:37:00.000	 I don't want to use it to set.
00:37:10.000	 I don't want to use it to set.
00:37:12.000	 We're gonna breathe a little bit.
00:37:24.000	 Bitch.
00:37:30.000	 I'm gonna die.
00:37:38.000	 He got a fucking speed booster.
00:37:40.000	 He was going too fast.
00:37:43.000	 Damn it.
00:38:00.000	 and
00:38:10.000	 any chance we get a deathstrain in two stream you guys seriously asking that last time I
00:38:15.640	 streamed what do you guys pay to advertise there's just something is this
00:38:20.440	 sort of some sort of stealth advertising there cannot be that many people that
00:38:24.080	 actually want to watch this shitty ass game
00:38:26.000	 did it just come out yeah I'm still playing that gotcha you like the first one it's
00:38:40.640	 okay it's fine it's a good enough strange strange way there's no way I would have
00:38:47.280	 finished it if I wasn't streaming yeah I like super he's in my uh fantasy football league
00:39:00.640	 super is normally good at fantasy football the only problem is that for whatever reason
00:39:17.600	 he likes to keep like five defenses on his team and if his team ever got hit by injuries and
00:39:24.160	 he wasn't just insanely lucky it would really hurt him but he's just like nope my team don't
00:39:29.920	 get injured it just doesn't happen and you know what he's right his team doesn't get
00:39:33.360	 injured it's a miracle because it's fucking fantasy football and your team always gets
00:39:39.520	 injured he just like yep sick one Barclay he's not gonna get hurt this year I just got a good
00:39:44.960	 feeling about it I wouldn't say I'm salty but it uh if I
00:39:59.760	 just
00:40:00.000	 say someone in that fantasy bowl league that I have a rivalry with
00:40:03.180	 the 10.
00:40:07.180	 Because I always play him in the playoffs.
00:40:23.900	 One year I had the most insane team ever.
00:40:27.620	 Like, I don't all the years we've done fantasy, but both was the strongest team.
00:40:32.660	 And, um, it lost a super in the playoffs because TJ Hogginson dropped like 57 on me.
00:40:42.100	 That's, is so fucked up.
00:40:46.780	 I still hate TJ Hogginson.
00:40:57.700	 I think that was the first year Tyre Hill went to the Dolphins.
00:41:05.700	 So, like, three years ago, maybe?
00:41:26.700	 I was like, I'm gonna do something.
00:41:28.700	 Dude, who the fuck is throwing these things backwards?
00:41:32.700	 Oh, my god.
00:41:36.700	 I really needed that for that turn, but I couldn't... shit.
00:42:00.000	 and
00:42:07.000	 I'm probably not going to play that Uma moves some mooney game I have no idea to pronounce it I was excited about it but
00:42:15.000	 I'm playing that other gacha and I'm not degenering after playing multiple gacha at the same time so
00:42:21.000	 that game lost its window
00:42:25.000	 maybe look Mario play it
00:42:39.000	 I don't know how to do any of the weird shit on these tracks other than like three so I'm just trying to race it consistently
00:42:47.000	 I'm not doing anything too stupid
00:42:53.000	 I'm definitely noticing like more of the rails and stuff
00:42:59.000	 but it's just hard with like all the chaos in Mario Kart like to just like randomly decide like oh yeah I'm totally gonna jump on that thing
00:43:07.000	 because if you miss it like all of a sudden you're kind of in the dirt and you fucked up your jump
00:43:12.000	 and
00:43:19.000	 that
00:43:23.000	 are you that it's like not even faster
00:43:28.000	 where is Sam's cool sput
00:43:33.000	 you
00:43:40.000	 discord only has one user and it's a mod
00:43:46.000	 I've not got my discord in probably five years
00:43:49.000	 the last time I wanted my discord it was to add
00:44:00.000	 message everyone and say hey can I borrow a PBE account?
00:44:09.220	 Now, you guys are allowed to do the fast strats on this map.
00:44:12.220	 All right, that's cheating.
00:44:15.220	 Then Teno didn't allow that.
00:44:18.460	 It's gonna get patched.
00:44:30.000	 Who knew there was gonna be a turn there?
00:44:41.840	 They never have 180 degree turns on these maps anymore.
00:44:45.800	 It's always 90 degrees.
00:44:49.320	 Shits blown my mind.
00:44:53.320	 He's so mighty fight.
00:44:57.320	 Get out of here.
00:45:02.320	 I don't need a get.
00:45:12.320	 I don't need a get.
00:45:16.320	 I should use it a little bit earlier so I could hit the Zidin's.
00:45:40.320	 Oh my god.
00:45:41.320	 The lines.
00:45:51.920	 We really do have no one in this lobby that knows any of the fucking super secrets on this
00:45:56.160	 map.
00:45:57.160	 We really are a bunch of fucking news.
00:46:00.000	 later pussy
00:46:05.000	 the fuck is we is everyone's stream saved me in this stupid lobby
00:46:19.360	 he
00:46:21.360	 and
00:46:25.360	 and
00:46:32.360	 wow, he man three two on boom actually but believe
00:46:36.360	 a beat
00:46:39.360	 I beat Wanky for it.
00:46:51.360	 Doing multiple tricks isn't any more helpful than one trick.
00:46:53.860	 I don't think so.
00:46:57.860	 You mean like when you're just in the air the entire time, like doing this?
00:47:00.860	 Yeah it doesn't do anything.
00:47:01.860	 The only thing that's doing is reposition you, which is useful sometimes.
00:47:09.360	 I'm excited for the new one.
00:47:16.360	 But I don't think I'll be as autistic with the new one as I was with the old one because it's pretty hard to top how autistic I was with the old one.
00:47:39.360	 I bought a brand new Xbox 360 controller.
00:47:46.360	 Or wait no I might have an Xbox one I can't remember it.
00:47:49.360	 I like I think it was Xbox one.
00:47:51.360	 And I bought it for Tony Hawk and I broke it in the time I was playing Tony Hawk because I was just ripping the controller and this really...
00:48:00.000	 weird way and when I was really stressed and playing I was like
00:48:05.840	 holding the controller it really tight and certain spots and then the thing just got like like the
00:48:11.120	 fucking motherboard or whatever and said the controller like warped and served doing like weird shit
00:48:16.880	 like it would just have me jump even when I wasn't jumping it had a bunch of ghost presses
00:48:24.480	 oh this is a fuck man
00:48:30.960	 that controller probably sucked as to though because it was like a Minecraft controller
00:48:41.440	 I think on this map you want to sandbag
00:48:48.320	 but I'm scared to just like straight up slow down
00:49:00.000	 I need something that can actually protect me on the last lap
00:49:30.320	 goal and mushroom I'm just gonna get lightning and I'm not related
00:49:43.440	 I popped this hurly
00:49:52.480	 I suck at saying that
00:50:00.000	 and I miss those items.
00:50:06.000	 Get them!
00:50:09.000	 I'll take 10th.
00:50:12.000	 This is basically maybe part of you.
00:50:17.000	 It's just, if you're in the front at the beginning of that map,
00:50:20.000	 it's just too likely that something terrible is going to happen on my pain.
00:50:25.000	 And then you get hit and everyone behind you has like a ton of
00:50:28.000	 fucking crazy shit.
00:50:45.000	 My power, my girl. There's like always a fucking storm in the lead.
00:50:59.000	 If my power does go out, all, all, all just start stream one in the power goes back up.
00:51:09.000	 Probably not.
00:51:12.000	 Hiya, eight. Thanks for so.
00:51:18.000	 I love the mountains. You're in storming the mountains all the time.
00:51:24.000	 Like every fucking day.
00:51:27.000	 There's either a storm here or there's a storm like right next to me.
00:51:34.000	 That just barely misses.
00:51:36.000	 It's weird.
00:51:38.000	 It only happens like...
00:51:42.000	 two hours in the day.
00:51:44.000	 And then the rest of the day it's either like fly-in.
00:51:57.000	 Did you see that? Whereabouts?
00:52:00.000	 to get hit by a super heat wave that's gonna kill a bunch of people with humidity.
00:52:05.000	 Um, no.
00:52:10.000	 It's just humidity.
00:52:15.000	 They just say the drink will happen.
00:52:24.000	 Whenever I look at the weather channel now, it's always like huge storm kills everyone.
00:52:29.000	 They're trying to click bait me, I think.
00:52:34.000	 I don't think it's quite as bad as they say.
00:52:59.000	 I'm sure it's just a bit of a mess.
00:53:09.000	 I'm sure it's just a bit of a mess.
00:53:14.000	 I'm sure it's just a bit of a mess.
00:53:23.000	 Define humidity.
00:53:25.000	 It's that stickiness outside.
00:53:28.000	 That hugs your face.
00:53:38.000	 Okay, happy to see you.
00:53:47.000	 Can't use a get.
00:53:52.000	 I'm sure it's just a bit of a mess.
00:54:00.000	 That insane could only got me 13th Jesus Christ.
00:54:24.080	 God furs with a golden from 12th.
00:54:26.240	 Hey, that's good man.
00:54:30.000	 That was sick. That actually worked.
00:55:00.000	 See, like that doesn't even make you go faster. That's just random trick shit. Like we're playing Tony Hawk.
00:55:18.640	 It's so weird that they put that in the game.
00:55:30.000	 Clint, are you here to stay forever? No.
00:55:34.000	 You motherfuckers picked freaking moomu meadows over whistle-top summit.
00:55:46.000	 I guess it was random because it's a three-leaf rare.
00:55:52.000	 I don't know how to play this man.
00:55:54.000	 I don't know the way that you play regular moomu meadows.
00:56:00.000	 and
00:56:07.000	 it's a game grind on the side
00:56:10.000	 and
00:56:20.000	 all I thought that all of a
00:56:25.000	 the
00:56:32.000	 it just started storming outside
00:56:35.000	 again here the rain
00:56:36.000	 this should as a weird
00:56:39.000	 that's all
00:56:43.000	 that's cool that guy's in second place he just happens to have a boost somehow he
00:56:49.000	 makes some crazy fucking pool shot with his green shell that he threw 15 minutes ago
00:56:59.000	 another guy with a boo
00:57:01.000	 he's got this chicken
00:57:04.000	 two ok
00:57:08.000	 that was so weird I actually did a standing drip when I didn't mean to you and actually kind of work
00:57:18.000	 it looked like a hit-up
00:57:20.000	 we're fucked
00:57:22.000	 we seriously are fucked
00:57:24.000	 we have no items
00:57:26.000	 we're with all the people with a million fucking items
00:57:30.000	 look at this shit
00:57:32.000	 I'm in 23rd
00:57:34.000	 uh
00:57:40.000	 we need to go man
00:57:48.000	 what
00:57:52.000	 I thought I got an item where the fuck did the item go
00:57:56.000	 thank you Daisy for not adding my life there
00:58:00.000	 I had one more item I could have got into the points there.
00:58:13.600	 That's unfortunate.
00:58:17.520	 Considering how dire it looked, it wasn't terrible.
00:58:27.600	 I can get middle of the pack first and locate it.
00:58:38.160	 I like the bat.
00:58:39.160	 I still don't have the bat.
00:58:41.880	 The bat unlocks.
00:58:51.160	 I'm gonna do a couple more and I'm gonna do time trial.
00:59:01.160	 We insolure on the discord.
00:59:22.920	 Why?
00:59:52.440	 If you block someone in chat, what is this?
01:00:00.000	 I'm not sure if I can do this.
01:00:02.000	 My position is kind of weird.
01:00:04.000	 I look at all these news.
01:00:08.000	 Do it in the fucking path.
01:00:12.000	 What?
01:00:26.000	 Dude, come on.
01:00:28.000	 That's fucked up.
01:00:30.000	 I'm gonna get you.
01:00:32.000	 Oh my god, get off my path.
01:00:35.000	 Look at this shit.
01:00:37.000	 I hate them.
01:00:38.000	 I will catch up to you, fucks.
01:00:40.000	 I promise you.
01:00:42.000	 I promise.
01:00:44.000	 I promise.
01:00:46.000	 This salty run back.
01:00:57.000	 I can eat, no.
01:01:14.000	 I gotta say that.
01:01:16.000	 I have to say that.
01:01:26.000	 I promise.
01:01:32.000	 I promise.
01:01:34.000	 I promise.
01:02:00.000	 I might be fucked.
01:02:08.000	 I can't use a mushroom here on this turn.
01:02:12.320	 And then the bullet bill hits me.
01:02:13.760	 Oh my god.
01:02:15.760	 Oh my god.
01:02:19.120	 I didn't go for anything at the end.
01:02:29.520	 The problem was I got bumped to the point where I was like pointed in the grass.
01:02:35.000	 It's like I gotta go for it.
01:02:37.360	 As in like I gotta just jump across.
01:02:39.200	 I don't know the choice.
01:02:45.520	 The problem was any time I was about to be in a position where I could like front run,
01:02:50.120	 I got just fucked by shit.
01:02:53.600	 At that part of the first lap, I was almost in such an insane
01:02:59.320	 spot and then some guy came in a nowhere and hit me with like a star.
01:03:07.960	 Another thing too was you really want to greed and have a mushroom for that final turn.
01:03:13.760	 Because there's not really another spot where you can use it in the same way.
01:03:18.240	 Because that jump across like mushroom doesn't save that much more time over just jumping
01:03:21.520	 on the wall.
01:03:22.520	 So like you want to save it.
01:03:28.520	 You gotta use it here.
01:03:34.480	 But when that lightning hit, whatever item I had I lost, which fucked me, I really needed
01:03:40.480	 one more item.
01:03:42.080	 Because you don't get any more, if you take the fast path you don't get any more items.
01:03:47.200	 And retrospects.
01:03:49.040	 No, I don't know.
01:03:50.880	 I still think I did the right thing.
01:03:56.760	 With all the carnage that happened, I still got like 13th or 14th.
01:04:00.000	 and that was with like a really bad fun to turn
01:04:05.000	 so
01:04:07.000	 sorry
01:04:16.000	 I guess that thing hit me that was like
01:04:19.000	 I think the dog needs something up for this
01:04:31.000	 raise
01:04:34.000	 I want not sure
01:04:40.000	 I was gambling for mushroom
01:04:51.000	 do you know what the hell are you doing here?
01:04:53.000	 okay
01:05:02.000	 I think she's going
01:05:10.000	 I
01:05:17.000	 I didn't expect
01:05:20.000	 I should start using my item like
01:05:31.000	 like right when there's a new set of items
01:05:36.000	 I
01:05:43.000	 got to have a mushroom for the final turn
01:05:49.000	 hopefully this is something
01:05:53.000	 I
01:05:57.000	 hold the fuck my dress
01:06:00.000	 My no, ultimately helping me.
01:06:02.000	 This has gotta be a mushroom.
01:06:14.000	 I'll take a ball.
01:06:16.000	 Takes.
01:06:30.000	 the
01:06:38.000	 genos been pnm bed lately
01:06:40.000	 i have to give her this heart med that makes it so she pees more
01:06:45.000	 and she's started peeing in my bed sometimes
01:06:58.000	 blaming the dogs it's around my feet
01:07:01.000	 unless i can pee out of my foot it's not me
01:07:05.000	 also she drinks well i told you about the way that she drinks water she like always
01:07:23.680	 spits it up if you give her like slightly too much you pretty much have to give her a
01:07:27.680	 fourth of a cup of water and
01:07:30.680	 because it's the smallest amount of water you can give her where she won't choke herself by drinking so fast
01:07:36.680	 she just drinks she just can't help it she just drinks too fucking fast every time
01:07:42.680	 she doesn't learn
01:07:53.680	 let's do it
01:08:00.000	 I wouldn't say it's necessarily funny it's more just like
01:08:10.000	 a quirk that is
01:08:15.000	 the
01:08:36.000	 to
01:08:46.180	 the real thing yet you know what I'll do
01:08:52.180	 the
01:09:18.180	 the
01:09:22.120	 only thing of my change of I think this is my favorite
01:09:24.620	 part or bike or whatever in the game
01:09:29.620	 of
01:09:53.520	 I gotta start doing that.
01:10:00.000	 the
01:10:26.000	 I'm sure they're gonna be a good one.
01:10:28.000	 That's the prize money people fuck that turn up.
01:10:31.000	 When it's the final lap, I'm not really that concerned about coins because
01:10:44.000	 once you get like the first four, if you go from like 5-6-7-8 whatever whatever you get
01:10:49.240	 like a small, small speed boost and if you take a tighter line you're gonna save more
01:10:53.280	 speed on the final lap anyways.
01:10:55.280	 Do you even have to do a standing drift for this?
01:11:19.280	 Really dude?
01:11:23.280	 That's so easy, what the fuck?
01:12:00.000	 I like when we have this like minute-long intermission and then we have maps of like time and everyone just does random
01:12:09.020	 and then it has this
01:12:16.040	 Does your sister like lebubus? My sister doesn't know what lebubus are. I can almost guarantee it. I don't know for sure, but I can almost guarantee it
01:12:25.060	 if you ask my sister what's crummy she'd know she had no idea what the fuck you're talking about
01:12:36.060	 which is a good thing to me
01:12:50.060	 you don't know what any of that is good
01:12:55.060	 I don't know what's happening
01:13:16.060	 I actually didn't tell you what's happening
01:13:21.060	 I
01:13:23.780	 want to save this for another thing I can cut
01:13:30.780	 I wanted to use it up here
01:13:33.700	 I think I fucked up
01:13:36.180	 At least I was gonna lose my items anyways
01:13:40.780	 It's actually our
01:13:43.500	 That's unfortunate
01:13:45.780	 But I probably was gonna get like a coin in the name of
01:13:52.020	 Oh shit
01:13:55.020	 I was trying to air dodge away from the blue shell instead I just weren't ready in that guy
01:14:00.000	 I got my drift suit out.
01:14:10.000	 It's alright.
01:14:15.000	 I just got to bridge this.
01:14:28.000	 I'm not sure if I can get my drift suit out.
01:14:38.000	 What hit me?
01:14:41.000	 That was kind of weird.
01:14:50.000	 That was alright.
01:15:02.000	 Can I mention you my first time shouting on Moomin's stream?
01:15:13.000	 He immediately shouted himself and had to change his pants.
01:15:18.000	 I didn't see the Donkey Kong direct.
01:15:28.000	 I don't really want to see it that much.
01:15:33.000	 Games that I already think.
01:15:36.000	 I'm going to enjoy it and I'm going to play no matter what.
01:15:39.000	 I don't look at it in a info forum because I just want to go into the game pretty fresh.
01:15:48.000	 That game interested me enough that first video I saw that I don't really feel the need to look at a ton of info for it.
01:15:57.000	 You can talk about it.
01:16:00.000	 It's not like you're gonna spoil me or anything. It's fine. Did it look cool?
01:16:07.000	 Is it a promising video at least?
01:16:15.000	 Well that's good.
01:16:21.000	 Consistent streamer alert.
01:16:24.000	 I don't know about that consistent, but
01:16:27.000	 Definitely better than before.
01:16:30.000	 I don't know why I said oops.
01:16:34.000	 I forget which way I'm supposed to go.
01:16:39.000	 Wow that works. Holy shit.
01:16:43.000	 Oops.
01:16:46.000	 I don't know why I said oops.
01:16:50.000	 It's not like I could do anything there.
01:17:00.000	 I don't know why I'm supposed to go to the top.
01:17:07.000	 If you had a ton of mushrooms there's no way going to pass these to the fastest.
01:17:13.000	 Alright, quite good up anyway.
01:17:15.000	 I should just end up in the easiest way.
01:17:22.000	 I'm saving you.
01:17:30.000	 I don't know why I'm supposed to go to the top.
01:17:34.000	 I don't know why I'm supposed to go to the top.
01:17:42.000	 Oops.
01:17:44.000	 I don't know why I'm supposed to go to the top.
01:17:56.000	 Wait.
01:17:57.000	 I don't know why.
01:17:59.000	 I can't.
01:18:00.000	 the
01:18:17.000	 I do it I swear I get that item it doesn't really matter much though
01:18:30.000	 I'm in trouble I'll speed that up again I don't remember where I'm supposed to jump there
01:18:43.000	 Oh my god I like this map
01:19:00.000	 I think I wish my own supposed to do this so I don't know the pressure
01:19:26.000	 I mean that same like a word
01:19:33.000	 This is the one
01:19:42.000	 Whoa
01:19:47.000	 Yeah I'm playing our monitor
01:19:54.000	 Have you seen the new gap jump tech on the 180 turn on whistle-saw
01:20:00.000	 I saw, I'm pretty sure I saw, but I, and it looked insane, but I'm like trying to picture it in my head and I don't really have a good picture of it.
01:20:11.620	 I know I saw the clip though.
01:20:15.660	 All I remember is I was like, wow, that's insane, and that's gonna be so hard to hit and run.
01:20:27.040	 But, there's some crazy tricks in this game that look like they're insane and aren't as hard as it seems.
01:20:32.820	 Like the great block ruined stuff, it looks absolutely fucking nuts and it's not bad.
01:20:44.260	 I don't know what I'm supposed to do as well.
01:20:46.340	 So we're just racing like normal.
01:20:57.900	 I hate getting hit on this spiral. It's so fucking brutal.
01:21:05.900	 I already even know what your supposed to do if you hit on this spiral.
01:21:10.900	 We're just fine.
01:21:17.900	 Yeah, this guy's got a pretty good setup.
01:21:19.900	 I'm gonna get hit by this, by his best shells.
01:21:22.900	 But, I'm gonna get hit by this.
01:21:27.900	 Watch this.
01:21:48.900	 And no one can hit me.
01:21:56.900	 I'm gonna get hit by this.
01:22:00.000	 I have no idea to play this map, but it's working.
01:22:05.500	 For now.
01:22:07.000	 But if someone does know they're gonna pass me, bro.
01:22:15.000	 That happens to happen.
01:22:18.000	 I'm keeping this.
01:22:21.000	 Oh shit.
01:22:30.000	 That coin was boot protection.
01:22:32.000	 Now we got nothing.
01:22:33.000	 We're naked.
01:22:34.000	 I gotta take this tight.
01:22:35.000	 I'm only getting this tickle.
01:22:36.000	 There's probably...
01:22:37.000	 Okay good.
01:22:38.000	 I have a banana.
01:22:39.000	 So I'm safe from any red shell.
01:22:41.000	 So they shouldn't throw a red shell because it'd be a waste of the red shell.
01:22:54.000	 Yay.
01:22:56.000	 Yeah, that's a DS map.
01:23:01.000	 I started this lobby with wonky having like 300 more points to me, and now he's 200 points down.
01:23:24.000	 Dude is tilting out the face of the earth.
01:23:27.000	 Poor wonky.
01:23:32.000	 He's practicing his little tricks.
01:23:35.000	 Good for him.
01:23:38.000	 Now it's not you, bro.
01:23:40.000	 It's just some sniper.
01:23:43.000	 Eagle, thanks for so.
01:23:49.000	 But in me pointing that out, he's just gonna hit me with more shit.
01:23:52.000	 So I'm probably shouldn't have pointed it out.
01:24:00.000	 I
01:24:02.000	 Would you have like double dash 2? No, I don't like double dash that much
01:24:08.560	 I only nice thing about double dash is being able to swap items and I like how characters have like specific items
01:24:22.960	 But I probably jump in like that
01:24:25.280	 Maybe this is the card thing
01:24:42.680	 Whenever I played so I played double dash
01:24:46.120	 I don't know I came remember I like played Mario Kart 8 and then I played double dash after it and it felt like shit
01:24:55.280	 I
01:24:58.800	 Just could knock it in a hand on it controls it all it like the drift thing just feels like really loose
01:25:09.200	 It the best way I could describe it and it's
01:25:13.520	 I guess it's not exactly like this, but it's like a Mario Kart 8 when you swap from a regular cart to like inside drift
01:25:20.240	 It's like what the fuck I can't figure out how to work this thing that's what playing double dash for me clothes like
01:25:45.240	 Wow
01:25:50.240	 You know, okay, that bill me a little bit just saying it happened a little bit
01:25:56.960	 I was gonna lose that much anyways. I was thinking
01:26:00.000	 I'm not like greeting really hard saving it for a better turn. I can actually cut a cross like this one.
01:26:14.000	 That was even worth it. I like good.
01:26:30.000	 I'm not like that.
01:26:40.000	 Alright, let's think.
01:26:51.000	 Oh my god, I'm so screwed.
01:26:54.000	 I'm not a bulldozer.
01:27:00.000	 Not a bulldozer.
01:27:03.000	 Okay, at least the money cut it for us.
01:27:10.000	 I swear these things last longer like based on how far back you are or something.
01:27:16.000	 Not like position on that. Please, let me breathe this.
01:27:24.000	 I'm not like that.
01:27:44.000	 Hey, I'll take that.
01:27:54.000	 This has been pretty like I get 11th, 12th, 13th, 4th.
01:28:00.000	 15th whatever I'm avoiding like the really bad endings for the most part
01:28:10.480	 Didn't gold shrimps get used up faster if you spam them
01:28:14.640	 I'm you know
01:28:16.640	 I can't remember that being the case in the past but maybe I used to just spam them so I didn't
01:28:23.680	 Fall that at all now I'm like almost positive stimulation based but
01:28:30.480	 I
01:28:34.080	 Know they last 10 seconds that's what it feels like
01:28:39.200	 It's always been spam. Okay good that makes me feel like if that wasn't true dude
01:28:44.800	 I played Mario pretty eight like wrong for like way too long
01:29:00.000	 I played one talking about Mario credit deal loves it's like the same shit
01:29:30.480	 Is this game woke? I don't know I
01:29:35.040	 Don't think so
01:29:39.840	 I took vacation for five days in that whistle top route is totally different
01:29:46.720	 Yeah, it's crazy
01:29:49.440	 Apparently they discovered some new shit
01:29:52.640	 That's like
01:29:54.640	 Observedly difficult but saves a full second or something I saw it
01:30:00.000	 someone linked me it on squitter and I saw it and then I remember thinking it's crazy and when I think back on it, it's like I never even saw the trick
01:30:07.200	 like I if you ask me to describe it the new trick is that I'd be like I don't know if you'd like jump on something and cross a path that you shouldn't be able to
01:30:17.200	 I have no problem
01:30:19.600	 this is a really short one
01:30:30.000	 what is going on?
01:30:44.400	 oh
01:30:47.600	 I was in such a good spot of that laden didn't hit
01:30:54.400	 what the fuck is with these bombs who is placing these?
01:31:00.640	 that's good
01:31:12.640	 karma for the red shell I hit people you're supposed to hit people red shells
01:31:18.480	 some Mario Kart works
01:31:22.480	 I should have got better than 7 that star was kind of slow
01:31:30.800	 do you know coming
01:31:35.200	 it
01:31:37.200	 it
01:31:40.200	 it
01:31:44.200	 it
01:31:50.200	 it
01:31:58.200	 Red Shelzer duration base
01:32:00.000	 you hold the long to the stun, yeah there's no way that's true.
01:32:13.680	 How is there a no-king bomb bomb racer?
01:32:18.400	 I'd like him in the game more than like Pity Perona. For some reason like Nintendo was obsessed
01:32:25.680	 with putting P Perona in like their game cube games.
01:32:31.760	 You're good. Oops. I didn't mean to pick them.
01:32:38.880	 We have 22 people picking random. It's gonna pick this food set of them.
01:32:48.400	 Pity's the lamest character. Although he is really good at Mario baseball.
01:32:56.160	 The methodology for them putting in like all the weird minions is you
01:33:04.400	 unlock them when you get turned into like something by the magician guy. I forget his fucking name.
01:33:20.880	 I guess King bomb bomb isn't like a rag you know you don't turn into him so
01:33:25.200	 you're weird.
01:33:43.360	 Okay that's the fastest route good to know.
01:33:47.760	 Where did that come? What's the plot?
01:34:00.000	 if
01:34:09.380	 you don't really like the toys lately
01:34:11.780	 Oh shit.
01:34:19.780	 That's not good.
01:34:32.780	 It's like another line.
01:34:36.780	 So if I don't have a mushroom, it seems like going up top would be...
01:34:41.780	 This is gonna eat...
01:34:44.780	 Oh my god.
01:34:46.780	 I shouldn't know that that was gonna...
01:34:48.780	 Fuck me out of the way.
01:34:50.780	 That was gross, isn't it?
01:34:52.780	 I gotta get around that.
01:34:56.780	 A zero point.
01:35:10.780	 Wow.
01:35:27.780	 So far behind the lining you miss, the advantage of being in 24th is no one can lining you.
01:35:39.780	 I'm not sure if I can do that.
01:35:43.780	 I'm not sure if I can do that.
01:35:48.780	 Did a golden mushroom dog toy would go hard, but she would destroy that thing so fast.
01:35:53.780	 She annihilates toys.
01:36:00.000	 she has four toys in this bedroom that are the exact same squirrel toy. They all look the same, but she only likes one of them.
01:36:16.000	 And I keep putting them downstairs and she keeps bringing them upstairs. I'd actually play Rumble Road.
01:36:47.000	 Because they're cheap and she likes them and then she gets tired of them and then you give her a new one and she's like, oh my god.
01:36:58.000	 Well, games do you like that suck? That's a good question.
01:37:05.000	 I like some gotch games and I think gotch games is kind of suck on a certain amount.
01:37:21.000	 I don't know. I still like RPG games a lot, but I don't like how the direction for RPG games has been to streamline it.
01:37:36.000	 Sometimes I get really into like stupid convoluted MMOs or gotchas or RPGs or whatever.
01:37:44.000	 It just has some ridiculously stupid town system, but it's...
01:37:52.000	 I still like it because I can dive and do it and think of all the options and stuff. That's fun for me.
01:38:00.000	 the
01:38:26.000	 it's like a hard question to ask but pretty good
01:38:56.000	 oh my screen it looks like I broke that green shell how did that not hurt me
01:39:03.000	 a fucking feather and third
01:39:14.000	 this maps cool but i can never really remember when it ends
01:39:22.000	 he had a fucking giant mushroom oh my god he is so lucky
01:39:34.000	 that's like collusion or something it's so lucky what the fuck
01:39:38.000	 do you guys have like a secret discord for all the screen snipers and you just talk about when did pop your lightings
01:39:44.000	 or some shit i can not believe that just happened oh my god
01:39:49.000	 i tilted myself
01:39:58.000	 this dumbass bulldole
01:40:00.000	 Please okay, I may have for it. It should be okay
01:40:07.560	 All right, it would be really really bad if some of them might even right now. I swear just don't do it
01:40:17.680	 I actually don't
01:40:30.000	 I think it's pretty likely I have something to hide so
01:40:38.160	 I want to use this step
01:40:46.400	 I threw that back of this to me
01:40:53.280	 That was a lightning
01:40:55.280	 What the fuck
01:40:57.280	 Shit
01:40:59.280	 Okay, the track doesn't end. I always feel like it's like about to end there
01:41:17.240	 These lines the most worth the sight of them for the end
01:41:27.280	 Oh, I did not deserve that
01:41:46.080	 I played Runescape for 10 years and didn't do a single quest until I was 17. I just ground
01:41:54.000	 skills the entire time
01:41:56.000	 Don't you get I have I've not played a ton of runescape myself
01:42:00.000	 But isn't the experience in that game predominantly doing quests?
01:42:03.500	 Like, did you just get no experience?
01:42:23.820	 That's not a good idea.
01:42:30.000	 I'm not participating in the BrioCart turn-y thing.
01:42:46.000	 I'm not really interested in the BrioCart.
01:42:56.000	 I'm not interested in the BrioCart.
01:43:02.000	 I think the fastest way to go through those rings has got to be like straight-drip the first one.
01:43:07.000	 Then try and like beam through them, like you're like slalomying or something.
01:43:12.000	 That'd be sweet.
01:43:13.000	 Dirty Dan 25, thanks for the sub.
01:43:19.000	 What's stock should you invest in?
01:43:21.000	 I don't know.
01:43:23.000	 I think AI stuff is kind of...
01:43:36.000	 I think they're making up a lot of shit behind the closed doors.
01:43:41.000	 Just to pump the stocks.
01:43:43.000	 So I'd be careful on that scene.
01:43:47.000	 Because I don't know when the music's gonna stop.
01:43:53.000	 The smartest thing you can do is probably watch 13 F's from some really shady investors.
01:43:59.000	 Not like...
01:44:00.000	 politicians even though that might be good. They trade on really short term time basis is
01:44:05.520	 so find someone like I used to like at the 13th acid and drucking miller
01:44:11.840	 I'm just copy trade them anything that he would trade for like long periods of time.
01:44:16.320	 I worked pretty well.
01:44:30.000	 Just invest in stamps or like Pokemon cards. See as good as things. That's my
01:45:00.320	 best advice I could do.
01:45:08.640	 They're not making any more CSGO skins. You gotta get a piece of that pie before it goes away.
01:45:17.040	 Except maybe they are making more CSGO skins. I really don't place CSGO and I couldn't say it.
01:45:22.160	 Fuck, how did I get hit? I had three fucking red shells!
01:45:25.120	 Oh, I don't know the smell super well. We're just gonna hope this works.
01:46:00.000	 I should have looked behind me and hit that error guy. That was still okay.
01:46:05.560	 I feel like I'm getting all these maps where I'm like too far.
01:46:14.920	 Like I'm not actually sandbagging. I just get into a part at the end where it's like
01:46:20.240	 well, I'm in fucking last at the beginning of the third lap. You know, I'm gonna get a bunch of
01:46:25.840	 good items. But I'm not like in a great spot where like, oh yeah, you know, I've been
01:46:32.600	 sandbagging this whole time. I've maxed coins. I got the two items I exactly want. Like I'm
01:46:37.280	 ready to fucking roll.
01:46:48.640	 I played magic gathering arena for a bit. I'm gonna do one more. Let's say this championship.
01:46:55.000	 And then I'm gonna time travel some stuff just for fun.
01:47:05.000	 It's trying to be first that all times a bad strategy. It can be. I would say it's definitely not as strong as it was in Mario
01:47:16.200	 Cartade. It depends on the track. It depends on the time. Like how far you're into the race.
01:47:24.000	 It doesn't a lot of stuff.
01:47:27.000	 It doesn't have far ahead. You are like if you're barely first and like you know items.
01:47:33.000	 And there's like a ton of people breathing down your neck. It's pretty rough.
01:47:37.000	 It's a way different situation though. If you can get to like burst with like a horn or
01:47:53.000	 with a mushroom or some crazy shit.
01:48:00.000	 this map feels so much better than the shitty one in Mario's heart 8 that was in the DLC
01:48:20.640	 it's
01:48:31.360	 Pull that you can war right there.
01:48:58.860	 Please be better than what I had.
01:49:02.360	 Pretty good.
01:49:11.360	 We gotta stay away from the guys giant.
01:49:15.360	 Wow.
01:49:16.360	 Did the guy in first must be really far ahead of him.
01:49:18.360	 He's got lucky.
01:49:21.360	 That's all right.
01:49:25.360	 I'm gonna use a G-E-X soon.
01:49:27.360	 Oh, shit.
01:49:28.360	 Ice free though.
01:49:31.360	 I'm gonna use him.
01:49:37.360	 Oh, that dude I got knocked like right at the end.
01:49:40.360	 That's unfortunate.
01:49:42.360	 Slow down for that.
01:49:45.360	 I gotta just pop everything.
01:49:46.360	 It's too late.
01:50:00.000	 Come as everyone has something to say now.
01:50:08.560	 I still like that track.
01:50:14.560	 It's cool you can wall ride that. Just watch someone fail wall riding that. There was a lot of people doing it though.
01:50:24.400	 That's an interesting track.
01:50:27.520	 I kind of like it.
01:50:30.640	 I'm gonna try some stuff. That was fun though.
01:50:48.400	 I just want to see what the time is exactly at now.
01:50:56.560	 Jesus dude. He's a second and a half ahead.
01:51:00.960	 What a beast.
01:51:02.960	 Cooks on his like
01:51:05.600	 bra.
01:51:09.040	 This guy should be proud though because he actually took it to Tyler.
01:51:13.520	 I'm just gonna assume he hasn't had the time to play. Ernie's playing another map. I don't blame him.
01:51:19.360	 I want to do DK space for it.
01:51:23.040	 Where the hell is DK space for?
01:51:25.520	 Is this it? Oh wow.
01:51:35.440	 Sweet. This is my map dude.
01:51:36.800	 Warrior on this map. This is a warrior map.
01:51:39.600	 Let's go and talk about it.
01:51:47.600	 See what he's doing.
01:51:49.600	 My ass is too stupid to find shit.
01:52:00.000	 and
01:52:07.000	 what do you mean by that you mean like crazy skips and stuff it's hard man it's a collaboration
01:52:10.000	 of
01:52:15.000	 the
01:52:22.000	 of
01:52:27.000	 okay he's already doing some stuff that I'm like
01:52:30.000	 isn't he's obviously doing it like really type it like doing it in a race seems doable
01:52:34.000	 I have no idea like what you're supposed to do pass this point
01:52:40.000	 and
01:52:47.000	 that was so tight
01:52:51.000	 so he doesn't go on any of those ramps that's good to know isn't going that one
01:52:57.000	 probably mushrooms again
01:53:01.000	 he drifts into that which is kind of cool
01:53:05.000	 so you want to be on the beach
01:53:12.000	 then here I'm really curious what he does he doesn't want right at all do wall writing slower
01:53:21.000	 they fucked up designing this dude so I was doing the fastest route the entire time without realizing it
01:53:32.000	 and
01:53:39.000	 I'm from YouTube hop yo ass on whistle top no
01:54:00.000	 Let's let whistle-tops stew a little bit more, alright?
01:54:03.840	 Then once everyone's figured out all the sick new strats, I go back to it
01:54:09.000	 I don't want to grind a shit ton and then my sweet ground-down time is like
01:54:14.960	 Validated because someone comes up with some new bonkers trap
01:54:24.840	 Array, I want to watch over my time little race
01:54:30.000	 I don't know, it doesn't even seem like I really need to watch like the second half of this, but
01:54:47.000	 This watching this is good, drifting into that smart
01:55:00.000	 This is like if I'm slower than hitting it all, my path is probably going to be different
01:55:24.000	 Okay
01:55:26.000	 Reasonful, so watch the beginning like 10 seconds one more time and then I'll race
01:55:35.000	 Valriding is good there and races to avoid item ricochet
01:55:41.000	 Do you have to straight drift there to like get the wall right to hit or do you just like trick off?
01:55:50.000	 Like one of the mini ramps and then it like catches you on it automatically
01:56:00.000	 He doesn't drift there. Okay.
01:56:03.680	 I need to change the warrior card though.
01:56:08.880	 You can just trick off of it. Okay. Do you have to try to catch on the wall?
01:56:13.040	 Do you have to trick like into the wall? Or can you like trick forward and then like turn into the wall?
01:56:19.040	 I catch this. I don't know what you're saying. I'm high as fuck. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.
01:56:30.720	 It's going. It's going.
01:56:32.720	 Either way. Okay. Maybe if like I'm on a really shitty run. I'll just experiment with that part and just like fuck around with it.
01:56:46.640	 Let's race.
01:56:49.200	 I forget to do this trick on this. I know I just watched it.
01:57:07.040	 Okay. It starts drifting there.
01:57:09.520	 Restart.
01:57:14.240	 Is this Mario Kart Wii Logan?
01:57:16.880	 The legendary?
01:57:33.760	 He goes a little wider.
01:57:36.720	 You should learn from YouTube videos Ghosts instead. I'm not sure what you mean. This is
01:57:48.160	 fine though. It's pretty convenient. I'll figure it out. Eventually.
01:58:00.000	 I know how to do this.
01:58:10.320	 Do you know what?
01:58:11.320	 You are sleeping in like the most un-possibly uncomfortable position for both of us.
01:58:20.880	 Don't forget to flap your wings.
01:58:35.520	 I need a wall right there.
01:58:36.640	 I'm never gonna make it.
01:58:42.040	 That was close.
01:58:47.240	 That person wrote Rizz and then got timed out instantly.
01:59:05.240	 Oh, I see what he's doing.
01:59:15.720	 He's drifting, but he's not.
01:59:17.800	 He's still tricks on the edge.
01:59:19.680	 I wasn't doing that.
01:59:20.680	 I forgot about that.
01:59:27.000	 I did the same clock in the state.
01:59:37.760	 Let's try it again.
01:59:44.240	 Close.
01:59:46.800	 They're only the wall right there.
02:00:00.000	 this is going to be like impossible to do in a race though
02:00:10.000	 because you do a turn like that and people are just going to hit you like once you start making your curve
02:00:19.000	 okay you actually don't want to lie it that's fucked up never mind no more wallride
02:00:24.000	 do that makes it so much harder you don't want to touch it at all
02:00:36.000	 oh full
02:00:55.000	 I want to see exactly where he starts the turn
02:01:01.000	 that was perfect there we go I just got to do that every time
02:01:05.000	 I'm not sure if you can see that
02:01:21.000	 okay I'm a pretty easy method to do this I think
02:01:26.000	 so you line up you see that crane
02:01:29.000	 you line up with the crane oops I actually much more fucked
02:01:35.000	 then you start the drift and then you like don't even touch the analog stick for like a second
02:01:42.000	 so like you start your left drift like oh now you start the turn like way later
02:01:51.000	 I don't know what the visual key is exactly that's
02:02:00.000	 Now it's kind of off now.
02:02:05.000	 I thought I had it.
02:02:08.000	 Never mind.
02:02:09.000	 Strat doesn't work.
02:02:10.000	 It's close though.
02:02:15.000	 It's really close.
02:02:23.000	 See that time it works, but not perfectly, and I didn't like it with the analog stick.
02:02:29.000	 I like had to pull back on it.
02:02:36.000	 Damn.
02:02:50.000	 I didn't do the jump.
02:02:57.000	 Oh shit.
02:03:04.000	 I'm going to continue.
02:03:09.000	 I don't totally remember what he does.
02:03:20.000	 I don't remember what he does here either.
02:03:22.000	 He like does, I don't even think he drifts.
02:03:25.000	 I think he just does like that.
02:03:32.000	 Yeah, like that.
02:03:40.000	 We're going to restart.
02:03:42.000	 If I can keep up with him a little bit on the first turn, it'll be easier to do.
02:03:54.000	 He'll remember what he's doing.
02:04:00.000	 the
02:04:10.180	 fuck I want way too wide
02:04:12.780	 the weird
02:04:18.280	 and
02:04:28.280	 this does feel like something though that if I were to practice it a while I could get it every time
02:04:38.280	 I think it's a good idea.
02:04:43.280	 It doesn't feel like the beginning whistle top shit which is like a
02:04:48.280	 it's
02:04:51.280	 a
02:04:59.280	 bad
02:05:04.280	 and
02:05:11.280	 I don't think he stays perfectly centered like right here but let me try and just go completely straight and see what happens. I think he
02:05:15.280	 tilts like a little bit like seas ghost. He's like a little
02:05:20.280	 and he ends up like slightly ahead but it's really like marginal.
02:05:27.280	 I think it's because when you go straight down here you see what kind of curbsy a little bit. I think you lose like a tiny amount of speed doing that.
02:05:33.280	 I think
02:05:40.280	 I think
02:05:48.280	 I think
02:05:52.280	 I think
02:05:57.280	 I think
02:06:00.000	 man he gets such a good angle what the fuck
02:06:10.600	 he goes like down probably doesn't matter
02:06:15.800	 he gets a way to turn there
02:06:22.200	 oh he doesn't mushroom here dude
02:06:27.000	 I'm ahead
02:06:29.000	 he does some weird drift shit which I don't understand exactly
02:06:37.000	 which is pretty fucking good considering we caught up to me
02:06:42.000	 I don't know if I can see the difference
02:06:49.000	 I don't want to keep up with them and see what he's doing
02:06:52.000	 and now he's
02:06:59.000	 now I've seen that drift thing in a different map
02:07:02.000	 they use it in great block ruins
02:07:06.000	 I should use it
02:07:12.000	 I'm going to rewind this just to see what he's doing
02:07:36.000	 okay so if you're really fast you can do that
02:07:50.000	 and he crushes this
02:07:55.000	 there's not really any secret here
02:07:57.000	 oh there's peace
02:08:00.000	 but I can use possible
02:08:04.000	 he drifts into that I remember that let me try that one more time
02:08:25.000	 then he goes across
02:08:27.000	 okay
02:08:30.000	 he's a possible drift from that outside line on the grass
02:08:40.000	 I don't know what you mean
02:08:42.000	 what even by outside line
02:08:44.000	 I'm not gonna spend a ton of time in this track
02:08:49.000	 I just wanted to see what was done
02:08:51.000	 I'll get like a pretty mediocre time
02:08:58.000	 and then move on to another map
02:09:08.000	 that's a bad line though whatever
02:09:13.000	 as a bad line,
02:09:29.080	 whatever
02:10:00.000	 Oh, you mean outside like that?
02:10:07.000	 Wait, that's for me.
02:10:15.000	 I don't know if I'm supposed to get that coin problem.
02:10:25.000	 Can't believe I didn't get hit by that, what the fuck?
02:10:29.000	 I'm gonna try again.
02:10:44.000	 Shazak, thanks for the suit.
02:10:52.000	 Honestly, I just want to switch to play GameCube games again until prime four.
02:10:57.000	 What are the gamecube games? I know it's F0GX.
02:11:02.000	 That doesn't have online matchmaking, right?
02:11:07.000	 Evan Vinny, thanks for so much.
02:11:12.000	 What does S, C, O, it's SoulColored, too? You know, the story mode, and that was pretty good.
02:11:17.000	 That's still prime of my favorite story mode for a many fighting in a replay.
02:11:27.000	 What does he go so loud?
02:11:34.000	 I'm telling you, I didn't like so space, I don't even really remember it, but I know I played it.
02:11:54.000	 You guys were just like four when that came out, so you thought it was awesome.
02:12:00.000	 the
02:12:27.000	 to oh yeah but I should. I'm gonna do it again. I never had an IQ although I wish I bought one.
02:12:45.960	 Someone once showed me a link of the Chintendo Wii, which was I assumed like a knockoff
02:12:53.000	 Nintendo Wii. But I could never find one to buy. I would totally have bought one of those.
02:13:12.680	 So you get the purple drift there.
02:13:14.680	 Does he when he lands he like drifts again or some shit? I don't know. I can do better. I want to do it one more.
02:13:33.240	 How old do you think we fucking are? Some of you are pretty old at this point.
02:13:43.720	 Even watch a while.
02:13:51.560	 I should have hit that. That would have been a really good one I think.
02:14:00.000	 so
02:14:18.980	 instead of lining up on the crane I'm lining up like in between the two ramps
02:14:22.260	 and then when I start drifting I'm holding right
02:14:26.260	 so like hold right then cut and I work decent
02:14:37.940	 just right to love
02:14:56.260	 I can't get purple day with it
02:15:01.260	 okay I did correct that time I missed every coin how is it even fucking possible
02:15:13.240	 at least I did it correctly.
02:15:15.760	 Wormy Dragon thanks for the sub.
02:15:17.960	 You think you'd wall right on that outside of the wall on the right on the second turn?
02:15:43.960	 I'm not sure if you're gonna die.
02:15:52.960	 You know I'll try.
02:15:55.960	 I mean like here.
02:16:00.000	 I don't know if you're gonna hit a pipe maybe
02:16:04.120	 If you could like straight drift on to it
02:16:09.840	 But then you'd be on the outside of the thing which makes you fly. I don't know what's called like a fly pad
02:16:16.280	 So I don't think it would be better
02:16:30.000	 I don't know I don't know if you took that up first turn like waste lower and you had more setup time you probably could
02:17:00.000	 You
02:17:14.960	 Shit
02:17:16.960	 and
02:17:31.960	 can you ask a question yeah
02:17:32.960	 will AI Stevens ever come back
02:17:35.960	 I don't think so
02:17:38.960	 there's just some guy that randomly decided to do it but he kept getting banned everywhere
02:17:42.960	 shit is real
02:18:00.000	 Hey, how is that a blivion remake?
02:18:04.560	 I like worth play
02:18:30.000	 I think I can get dripply side of it.
02:18:40.000	 Two left tricks on the second bounce pad.
02:19:00.000	 just as four runs I don't think he does left one but I could be wrong
02:19:04.800	 not really planning on collabing with anyone except
02:19:09.900	 um maybe doing Mario Kart stuff at some point
02:19:15.000	 I thought it would work what the fuck
02:19:27.500	 I mean I don't really feel like it right now and now
02:19:37.500	 I mean I don't really feel like it right now and now
02:19:45.500	 now and now
02:20:00.000	 I was bad.
02:20:27.000	 If I can finish this and not majorly fuck up anything, that doesn't count.
02:20:37.000	 I'll move onto a different map.
02:20:57.000	 I'm not sure if I can finish this.
02:21:07.000	 Damn it.
02:21:11.000	 Favorite underrated DS game? Easy answer. 999.
02:21:15.000	 I'm not sure if I can finish this.
02:21:23.000	 I'm not sure if I can finish this.
02:21:31.000	 Maybe Phoenix right?
02:21:34.000	 But Phoenix right?
02:21:36.000	 That's like a lot more people.
02:21:41.000	 I'm not sure if I can finish this.
02:21:51.000	 I'm not sure if I can finish this.
02:21:56.000	 Dude, she has her paw on the half the deck.
02:22:00.000	 center the controller and is like resting all my hand. You got to move.
02:22:20.720	 She's done all right. She's got health problems but like she's in a good mood and
02:22:29.120	 acts like herself. We all get a little chat. She's 11. They're manageable.
02:22:59.120	 How come she's in there?
02:23:29.120	 There's like some weird fucking thing that happens.
02:23:33.120	 Where my channel starts spashing out and I can't figure out what the fuck the problem is.
02:23:41.200	 miniature doxons are great dogs but they have tons of health issues.
02:23:44.440	 Her backs really good which they set is like really common but yeah she's got hard
02:23:49.880	 she's which they set is also pretty common.
02:24:00.000	 is the drip we're doing if you don't get the boost no I gotta get the boost I'm trying
02:24:06.720	 to get the boost I just keep screwing up I should rewind it next time I mess it up I'm
02:24:13.800	 keep attempting it though this is pretty good
02:24:43.800	 I should have rewound fuck obviously I didn't mean to go on the rail I just it
02:25:00.120	 got I don't know is weird
02:26:00.000	 Damn. If I'm a little bit faster that would work.
02:26:09.000	 Fuck. I need to just be like a couple of tenths faster.
02:26:24.000	 Will you ever update your profile picture? I like it.
02:26:28.000	 Do you think it needs to change?
02:26:32.000	 I don't think I need to rewind. I get it now.
02:26:41.000	 This is fucked up. I didn't go wide enough.
02:26:45.000	 I don't know why I know.
02:26:54.000	 If I change it, I'm worried people won't remember that this is my account.
02:27:07.000	 I don't think my average viewer is that intelligent.
02:27:14.000	 I don't think I need to change it.
02:27:24.000	 I don't think I need to change it.
02:27:32.000	 Ah, damn it.
02:27:35.000	 Maybe I'll rewind it. I thought I would nail that for sure.
02:27:38.000	 Thanks for the fact I always pay for social.
02:27:40.000	 I'm glad you're a functioning member of society.
02:27:54.000	 Oh, that was kind of good.
02:28:00.000	 I don't even know if he is a fucking man with society but it's fine if you're not.
02:28:15.000	 Fuck.
02:28:20.000	 I just can't get it. I'm rewinding.
02:28:27.000	 I'm going to wave back.
02:28:41.000	 Barrels might be weird.
02:28:48.000	 See, but like, he doesn't boost until he lands.
02:28:54.000	 Which I find very odd.
02:28:59.000	 It's like the boost gets clipped or something.
02:29:09.000	 Oh, wait. I think I get it now. He just doesn't release right trigger.
02:29:14.000	 So, like if he lets it go in the air, it's going to release whenever he lets it go.
02:29:21.000	 It's just based on when you let go of the button.
02:29:31.000	 I fucking let it go again.
02:29:39.000	 You need to trick to get the boost. What do you mean?
02:29:53.000	 Wait, now I got the zomer gear. I don't get it.
02:29:56.000	 Trick in the air. Press. Just press trick mid air.
02:30:00.000	 What time does he do it?
02:30:07.440	 Like middle of the jump beginning of the jump end of the jump
02:30:16.440	 Like what the fuck that's the same way I filled in the run and I understand
02:30:25.000	 He does a right trick immediately. Okay. That's good enough
02:30:30.000	 So he's like
02:30:36.000	 He drips he drips he drips that doesn't count fuck these barrels
02:30:44.640	 Probably won't work. Oh, maybe
02:30:52.800	 I get it
02:31:00.000	 Glad
02:31:07.120	 That we rewound for that because I would never have figured that out I was thinking about
02:31:12.080	 Okay
02:31:14.720	 Thank you. I'm still riding my boat, but it makes no sense and it's a bunch of like scattered stories that are big we connected that
02:31:22.080	 Barely have any sort of payoff
02:31:30.560	 It's not work
02:31:34.160	 Need to go wider
02:31:41.200	 If you check for once or four times the reason why I'm doing it more is because it like gives me a little bit of air momentum
02:31:47.840	 It's not about the boost at the end. It's like my angle's kind of off
02:31:50.800	 So I'm just doing it try and make it fix it so
02:32:00.000	 when I need a pen name
02:32:16.000	 my pen A will be
02:32:19.000	 X shadow sniper 42 X
02:32:23.000	 smoke lock
02:32:25.000	 420 creep
02:32:28.000	 I don't think making a dark card pack is a good idea because people think it's like some stupid smud
02:32:41.000	 no it's not
02:32:51.000	 I don't know
02:33:21.000	 one
02:33:28.000	 one
02:33:31.000	 one
02:33:36.000	 one
02:33:39.000	 one
02:34:00.000	 I
02:34:17.240	 Oh shit
02:34:19.240	 I
02:34:24.160	 Didn't even pee be I have no idea. Okay, okay?
02:34:29.060	 New record apparently
02:34:31.300	 134.8 what was my old one?
02:34:37.240	 One more
02:34:39.240	 135.5. Hey, that's pretty good for a map like this not bad
02:34:51.240	 Pretty
02:34:55.240	 That bounce off the barrel might be hard to replicate, but it didn't seem like it was too much slower
02:35:09.240	 I think for the tri-hard
02:35:13.240	 Ask you do people even like post-asky that much anymore feel like it's a loss of art
02:35:24.840	 Why don't you race against your own ghost because it sucks
02:35:39.240	 I'm not sure
02:35:59.240	 Give it
02:36:00.000	 It's good.
02:36:15.480	 That's like how I'm actually supposed to do it.
02:36:20.480	 I wasn't such a pussy there.
02:36:29.480	 I bet that wouldn't even hit me.
02:36:35.400	 What the fuck?
02:36:46.080	 I'm slower than my PB though.
02:36:56.080	 Maybe I can get it out.
02:37:10.400	 I can see boobs and then the rest of it is just like a bunch of scribbles.
02:37:23.760	 That also broke.
02:37:25.080	 I have no idea what that is.
02:37:27.680	 That takes up the entire chat though.
02:37:42.240	 I'm turning too early.
02:37:49.200	 I'm turning too early.
02:37:59.200	 Yeah, I know you guys can't see it only.
02:38:00.000	 to it.
02:38:01.000	 I don't play lead.
02:38:07.000	 You're looking at the wrong account.
02:38:10.000	 I'm definitely not diamond two.
02:38:13.440	 What the fuck is happening?
02:38:15.160	 Why do people think I'm playing switch?
02:38:17.680	 Mario could hate what I'm not.
02:38:19.280	 People think I'm playing lead would I'm not?
02:38:21.920	 What the fuck?
02:38:22.920	 Yeah, someone thought I was playing two as a king of them.
02:38:42.600	 I heard that and I still don't understand it.
02:38:46.600	 That was perfect.
02:39:17.600	 Oh fuck.
02:39:25.600	 Oh my god, I didn't get hit.
02:39:27.600	 What the fuck though, this has got to be slower.
02:39:33.920	 I screwed up, oh my god.
02:39:40.160	 It screwed up so much now.
02:39:53.280	 That part is just weird because it's like really easy if I'm as fast as he is but I'm
02:40:00.000	 not.
02:40:14.000	 The ego thund thanks for so.
02:40:24.000	 and
02:40:30.640	 Close
02:40:32.640	 What happened a whistle
02:40:35.640	 I just haven't felt like playing it
02:40:38.280	 I'm not gonna say that long on this I want one more PB and then I'm gonna move on to the track
02:40:42.520	 But I'm gonna do a new track. I'm not gonna do a whistle today. I'm taking time off on it
02:40:50.680	 That's bad that time I actually waited too long
02:40:54.000	 I
02:41:07.520	 Try to am a mo call the poge
02:41:12.120	 Which like I tried to yesterday and thought it was prank
02:41:16.580	 I was gonna say it's pretty good. I guess it's pretty good
02:41:24.960	 Shit's kind of weird
02:41:36.840	 You should do where you're stating after this
02:41:40.240	 Okay
02:41:54.000	 Dude, I can't do it in the game or what the fuck it's my bead. Maybe it's tighter than I thought it was
02:42:00.000	 that's not me
02:42:07.000	 I'm not even named cleanse even anymore
02:42:11.000	 I'm named Clunker Clank after get
02:42:30.000	 Everyone in the game should just agree
02:42:33.000	 Oh wait
02:42:35.000	 Oh my god
02:42:37.000	 I've written a place this game should just agree
02:42:46.000	 You only time trial whistle top
02:42:48.000	 That's it. You know what? Just to be fair
02:42:50.000	 We should just find a map that no one gives a fuck about
02:42:54.000	 And like people barely time trial
02:42:56.000	 And all of us should just be like this is the only map we play now
02:42:59.000	 We're all starting from scratch. It's gonna be totally and completely fair
02:43:09.000	 Like that stupid dynamat
02:43:14.000	 That's a decent map
02:43:16.000	 No one time trial is that
02:43:29.000	 So is it not like minus point six at this part at one point?
02:43:46.000	 See that room was good
02:43:50.000	 I got recommended a video of a dude literally again
02:44:00.000	 I will record that so you're wrong.
02:44:02.000	 Damn it.
02:44:04.000	 What's another map people don't get a shit about?
02:44:06.000	 We should time trial that stupid baby park map. That's like a beach.
02:44:22.000	 The problem is wasting them. I wouldn't say wasting, but like mushrooms are pretty valuable for this being able to skip those 180.
02:44:30.000	 I think turns.
02:44:36.000	 Yep, that was what I meant to the wall.
02:44:38.000	 Kind of a bad story, whatever.
02:45:00.000	 What the hell?
02:45:04.000	 What the hell is that?
02:45:12.000	 Is it pee-beable?
02:45:16.000	 Give it to me straight.
02:46:00.000	 Oh my god that wasn't insane
02:46:30.000	 Oh my god did this part
02:46:59.680	 It scares the shit out of me
02:47:06.680	 That's a PB
02:47:09.680	 Alright we'll move on for now
02:47:19.680	 This is the 33 would be nice
02:47:21.680	 I had it like a 133
02:47:26.680	 We'll come back this someday
02:47:30.680	 My favorite thing about this track is that the wallride part is faster just to not do anything
02:47:36.680	 And that you get a race as B-Wario
02:47:50.680	 Oh yeah we're in stadium
02:47:56.680	 Tyler is this a different Tyler SVC
02:48:00.000	 He's a he Tyler who the fuck is that?
02:48:03.400	 There's multiple Tyler's where did they come from?
02:48:11.680	 Why does the SVC guilds own this tracks so hard?
02:48:22.080	 They're not even first
02:48:24.520	 Did VF Tyler would be first by like a second?
02:48:30.960	 Alright, let's see what's going to do this.
02:48:36.080	 There's a ton of Mario Kart clans. How do you even organize Mario Kart clan?
02:48:40.240	 Like do you see someone on a time trial list?
02:48:42.800	 And you like like can you send him a friend request? Like how do you meet up?
02:48:50.720	 Do you just add a clan tag and hope that people just randomly add it?
02:49:00.800	 This isn't the same as that
02:49:05.200	 That's in the old tricky area
02:49:10.400	 Oh, I'm gonna annihilate people on this track next time we play it
02:49:27.040	 MK Central.com I see
02:49:30.080	 This doesn't look as hard as I thought it was going to be
02:49:34.720	 But I did also think there was gonna be more wall out of it
02:49:40.000	 He's not riding the wall that much
02:49:43.600	 He's riding more
02:49:46.000	 And I'm at home when I'm driving
02:49:51.440	 Wall riding's weird
02:49:53.440	 Okay, so he does a different way I guess if he doesn't want the coin
02:50:00.000	 because that seems way faster than the other one.
02:50:04.000	 And he doesn't go for the first jump.
02:50:07.000	 He like, I want to see him do that again.
02:50:11.000	 He jumps over it so he doesn't go as high so he can land quicker.
02:50:26.000	 So he does a left there.
02:50:31.000	 Maybe it's hard to get that much by you.
02:50:37.000	 I really know.
02:50:39.000	 See, he jumps before it.
02:50:44.000	 He does back flips too, which I don't know if that matters.
02:50:47.000	 We'll watch it again.
02:50:49.000	 Oh, watch it.
02:50:52.000	 I don't know if that matters.
02:50:56.000	 We'll watch it again.
02:50:59.000	 Oh, watch it again.
02:51:00.000	 Which part is really hard?
02:51:02.000	 You mean the part where he does the 180 and gets enough height so like get up there?
02:51:06.000	 Like getting the height might be really, really difficult.
02:51:11.000	 No idea.
02:51:25.000	 Oh, I see.
02:51:32.000	 You go here because there's like 7.20.
02:51:38.000	 I can't be that much.
02:51:41.000	 I'm probably going to brace this for a little bit and then have to watch it again.
02:51:54.000	 He's really specific.
02:52:00.000	 When he's doing those jumps on like the round
02:52:03.760	 Like he's doing backflips and he waits a like longer than I expected to
02:52:23.040	 Then he does a left like let's see it's the very beginning of the game
02:52:30.000	 Like there he doesn't
02:52:46.760	 I want to see the very beginning of it. I'll watch the very beginning again
02:52:50.560	 Then I'll do it
02:52:51.560	 Or attempt to do the beginning
02:52:54.080	 Can't go if you did a backflip or frontflip but it'll probably obviously
02:53:01.080	 I
02:53:02.080	 Fuck it in a few fill it a million times
02:53:04.080	 Okay times
02:53:19.560	 The vibe of your eSports team what the hell was even the name of my eSports team?
02:53:23.360	 I don't remember if I gave it a name
02:53:27.360	 I do remember the idea though
02:53:29.360	 See like he does really late from clips there so he doesn't like trip off into the areas
02:53:35.800	 He just gets the boost on your own
02:53:54.080	 Okay, let's see
02:54:00.000	 ...
02:54:05.000	 ...
02:54:08.000	 ...
02:54:12.000	 Oh wait, come boil the beef. Let's change character.
02:54:16.000	 Why is that emotes so big?
02:54:28.000	 I forgot to be a goal. I think it's this. Yes.
02:54:33.000	 How do I pronounce this guy's name?
02:54:38.000	 They paid 100 bits to supersize it. Oh, what the fuck?
02:54:44.000	 What a beast.
02:54:56.000	 How come I wait? Hold on. How come I can't trick that?
02:55:02.000	 How come I what the fuck?
02:55:11.000	 Too fat.
02:55:14.000	 How come tricks seem to not come out sometimes?
02:55:19.000	 Is it like there's a specific window I can't?
02:55:24.000	 Because I think I need that trick to come out.
02:55:28.000	 Maybe I'm doing it too late.
02:55:34.000	 I don't know what the timing is though.
02:55:39.000	 See like a mash in it. It's not coming out. He tilts earlier.
02:55:46.000	 Shake your controller. Oh my god. It's that shit.
02:55:54.000	 Do I have to turn the setting on?
02:56:00.000	 the
02:56:07.000	 is an on by default let me I'll test it I'll just start shaking my controller when I'm in the air
02:56:13.000	 wow it is on with the fuck
02:56:20.000	 I'm not going to be able to do like a specific like jump direction though
02:56:30.000	 I hate this
02:56:36.000	 oh he goes earlier
02:56:42.000	 I hate this shaking shit so much
02:56:47.000	 and whistle-tob people kept telling me to do it and I
02:56:52.000	 abstained
02:57:00.000	 I need to turn like when I'm in the air
02:57:02.000	 because he's just turning so much quicker than me but
02:57:06.000	 I'm just delayed in my reaction
02:57:17.000	 he did it is didn't look like
02:57:22.000	 I had like way more air than him
02:57:33.000	 oh I'm mushroomed
02:57:47.000	 I'm just going to do like a jump
02:57:57.000	 and then instead of going so high on the ramp I need to
02:58:00.000	 turn quicker.
02:58:15.000	 forgot to trick.
02:58:20.000	 do you think I should be shaking for like all these tricks?
02:58:23.000	 there's no way.
02:58:30.000	 it's like I shake for the first one I shake for the second one and then my brain doesn't connect the dots that I need to like press it starting again.
02:58:49.000	 it's fucked.
02:58:53.000	 it's over.
02:59:00.000	 if you don't get that late trick you can't make that jump.
02:59:08.000	 well maybe you can't.
02:59:15.000	 but it's harder.
02:59:17.000	 it's weird.
02:59:23.000	 I'm not sure if you guys know me.
02:59:27.000	 when I shake the controller.
02:59:30.000	 like my like the light.
02:59:32.000	 like this left trigger is like really loose man.
02:59:37.000	 it wants to be press.
02:59:49.000	 close.
02:59:50.000	 I did this is a new pro 2 controller.
03:00:00.000	 the
03:00:07.000	 okay you can still make
03:00:10.000	 this controller was eighty five dollars
03:00:22.000	 What other track does Tyler have a world record on?
03:00:35.000	 Close. That turns a little tight. I don't exactly know where I am like lining up to do it.
03:00:44.000	 It feels just like a switch to broken sholar, that's not true.
03:00:50.000	 It feels different. It feels better in my opinion. I like the sticks.
03:00:56.000	 The buttons are more tactile.
03:01:06.000	 I forgot to trick.
03:01:11.000	 Why are there so many people named Tyler that are good at Mario Kart?
03:01:20.000	 I don't think there's that many.
03:01:37.000	 Why are there so many people named Clint that don't stream a lot?
03:01:42.000	 I don't think there's that many.
03:01:49.000	 How did they launch so far? It's because they left.
03:02:00.000	 Jump right here. Oh wait, how do they launch that far?
03:02:04.400	 Chad, how do they launch that far? I thought I'd launch farther than that.
03:02:10.400	 Maybe I gotta do the jump in a like more specific timing.
03:02:14.800	 I did left trick. At least I think I did left trick. Shake it.
03:02:22.080	 Why is shaking so pee?
03:02:30.000	 Did it too late, alright.
03:03:00.400	 Nintendo making shaking better because they want people to use their stupid gimmicks?
03:03:04.720	 True dude.
03:03:09.440	 I'm like trying to shake it but I didn't shake it aggressively enough.
03:03:14.480	 I'm worried. I shouldn't have to do like this every single time I want to do a fucking trick.
03:03:30.000	 This was easy to make shuffer. It's pretty stupid.
03:04:00.000	 I need to turn left earlier, because he's going up the ramp on that left wall quicker than
03:04:20.080	 me every single time.
03:04:27.080	 There we go.
03:04:35.800	 I jumped too early.
03:04:36.800	 Oh my god, it might still work.
03:04:38.120	 Oh, the fuck.
03:04:40.760	 The damp is fake.
03:04:45.800	 We're just 10% of the time.
03:05:02.440	 He also, like, right at the start, I like move a little bit to the left.
03:05:06.960	 He moves a little bit more to the left.
03:05:09.640	 I need to move more to the left.
03:05:28.960	 Not quite that much to the left and turn it more.
03:05:39.600	 I'm jumping too early.
03:06:00.000	 the
03:06:07.000	 is a scuff
03:06:12.500	 that first wall is really important
03:06:15.300	 to get it right
03:06:24.300	 that
03:06:34.300	 that
03:06:42.300	 did that jump is so weird so like if you go too far to the left lag to get pissed off
03:06:50.300	 the
03:06:57.300	 problem is I can't rewind once like to
03:07:11.300	 the
03:07:37.300	 I'm not shaking after the first two jumps.
03:07:41.700	 I don't know if I need to, but like shaking in specific directions doesn't make sense to me.
03:07:46.400	 Like what am I doing? I'm doing this. Am I doing this? Like I don't understand.
03:07:50.400	 Why did you leave for years?
03:08:00.000	 I've never subbed away.
03:08:01.320	 I only left for one year.
03:08:10.920	 I needed to jump off that, like the moment I get on it, I think.
03:08:15.240	 I'm not jumping quickly enough.
03:08:17.280	 Did you see whistle-tap 151 now?
03:08:19.320	 I'm not gonna check whistle.
03:08:20.320	 I mean, I saw the trick it's insane,
03:08:22.320	 but I'm not focused on whistle-tap.
03:08:30.560	 Dude, what the fuck lack of two?
03:08:32.800	 How is he so picky?
03:08:37.040	 Ah, there was like two or three years
03:08:38.840	 where I was extremely inconsistent,
03:08:40.400	 so he was not totally wrong.
03:08:43.600	 I thought my streaming hours.
03:08:50.400	 There we go.
03:08:53.520	 That's good.
03:09:00.000	 I'm not gonna get pissed.
03:09:05.000	 That was perfect.
03:09:07.000	 That was actually it.
03:09:12.000	 That was not true.
03:09:16.000	 I was not true.
03:09:17.000	 I was not true.
03:09:24.000	 I was not true.
03:09:28.000	 Okay, a couple things I can think of here.
03:09:31.000	 I want to do my jump, you know,
03:09:32.280	 how I'm jumping, jumping, then getting a boost.
03:09:35.000	 I think I want to have my second jump
03:09:37.000	 be closer to the end of the pipe,
03:09:39.000	 so that I'm getting the boost into the pipe.
03:09:42.000	 Yeah, that's good.
03:10:00.000	 that
03:10:11.000	 there's also like a specific timing that I'm not totally sure on
03:10:15.000	 what the hell is the timing it
03:10:18.000	 maybe that's the important point
03:10:21.000	 that's to it
03:10:32.000	 he lands like on the tape
03:10:36.000	 so to do that
03:10:42.000	 and
03:10:50.000	 it's too far
03:10:52.000	 should let's be one to like you
03:11:03.000	 as to light and do it earlier
03:11:09.000	 I need to do it earlier
03:11:16.000	 there we go
03:11:18.000	 okay I'm starting to get it you see how sometimes I get this like really weird speed boost like
03:11:23.000	 here up
03:11:25.000	 like you see that
03:11:28.000	 I get like a way bigger speed boost I'm going to do a late one and I'll show you what it looks like
03:11:32.000	 it's going to be late
03:11:36.000	 I didn't jump it all
03:11:38.000	 which so I guess that is really late
03:11:42.000	 if you do it like super late you just kind of don't like nothing happens
03:11:57.000	 like that that's late
03:12:00.000	 Your jump like didn't affect anything so you gotta do it early
03:12:05.480	 Like that
03:12:07.480	 They said lack of you can't be a little fucking bitch and get mad at you for no reason
03:12:12.480	 When I'm on that rail I needed the timing to be quick like really really really quick
03:12:39.600	 I might actually trick on that but I don't know maybe I'll explain it
03:12:45.360	 I'm gonna try and trick up there
03:12:49.360	 Wait no tricking doesn't work
03:12:53.040	 It did work holy shit
03:12:55.960	 That feels extremely uncomfortable. I'm never gonna do that again. I'm just gonna time it better
03:13:09.600	 I should have rewound why is he so insecure about his book? I just wanted to be good
03:13:39.880	 And I'd never have anyone ever go straight at because I want it to be like I wrote it
03:13:49.440	 And it's personal
03:13:52.160	 Oh
03:13:59.440	 Even though
03:14:00.000	 it's not good, at least wanted to be like I made it. Man, it is so hard for me to
03:14:18.320	 tell if Lack is gonna like grab the R1. Is there anything I need to, I assume this isn't
03:14:29.800	 the case, but I'm just double checking is there anything I need to press when I land? I just
03:14:40.240	 catch if my angle's right, correct? Like it's either just gonna, it's gonna catch or it's
03:14:45.520	 not gonna catch.
03:15:09.520	 What do you hold when you're in the air?
03:15:16.520	 I should have R1, hold you right.
03:15:35.520	 I see, okay. I fucking should have R1 again, I totally forgot.
03:15:46.520	 There you go.
03:15:55.520	 Late, let's sign a word.
03:16:00.000	 You know, I guess if you get it that late, instead of just jumping right away, I should just write it out.
03:16:08.640	 You wouldn't lose that much time.
03:16:14.000	 Like if I did that on a race and like fuck it up.
03:16:16.000	 I'm not sure if I can get it out.
03:16:28.000	 So it's like you hold it seems to me like you're holding like full right and maybe full left.
03:16:35.000	 But I'm not getting enough distance. So maybe it's like upright up left or maybe I just need what the fuck.
03:16:47.000	 So I'm going to read why and where is this kind of stupid.
03:17:12.000	 I tried to read one, but it wouldn't let me.
03:17:16.000	 I'm not sure if I can get it out.
03:17:35.000	 Oh, I tried to write it out and it didn't work.
03:17:39.000	 I'm trying to shake at the beginning, but I'm like not, it's not coming out.
03:17:42.000	 So I don't know if I'm doing it at the wrong time or...
03:17:46.000	 I'm not motioning my arm enough.
03:17:49.000	 So stupid that I got to use motion controls.
03:17:57.000	 Why is this ghost outspeeding? You so much as a beginning.
03:18:00.000	 is it's the world record on a highly played map?
03:18:11.600	 And every little thing he does at the beginning is perfect.
03:18:20.000	 So if I don't do it absolutely perfectly, he's going to start getting really fast.
03:18:30.000	 That's nice.
03:18:55.000	 Too late.
03:18:57.000	 I do think those jumps are like here at the front.
03:19:02.000	 Like getting that extra boost.
03:19:05.000	 But I also get the sense I'm like holding the wrong direction in the air.
03:19:20.000	 Or like I'm holding...
03:19:26.000	 Because I'm just a little bit short every time.
03:19:36.000	 Maybe I'm jumping too late.
03:19:43.000	 And if I'd...that's pretty close.
03:19:56.000	 That might have been too early.
03:20:00.000	 the
03:20:05.000	 the
03:20:08.000	 as to
03:20:12.000	 the
03:20:15.000	 man that was that was a lot of distance
03:20:25.000	 the
03:20:41.180	 to
03:20:51.180	 see see the like
03:20:53.180	 great marks on this pipe
03:20:57.180	 I think I want to start my jump like here
03:21:01.180	 just after that.
03:21:29.180	 jump off the right wheel.
03:21:31.180	 Holy shit.
03:21:33.180	 Is that actually matter?
03:21:35.180	 Are you holding right there?
03:21:37.180	 Yeah.
03:21:39.180	 I'm holding right after I do the trick.
03:21:42.180	 I'm just holding right the whole time.
03:21:44.180	 There we go.
03:22:00.000	 the
03:22:19.920	 of a chat.
03:22:32.920	 Wow.
03:22:35.920	 Oh my god.
03:22:36.920	 I'm hurt.
03:22:44.920	 How dare you.
03:22:49.920	 Okay, I get it.
03:22:51.920	 What I was doing was...
03:22:56.920	 Please tell me I get this.
03:23:11.920	 Yeah.
03:23:14.920	 So you do a left trick.
03:23:17.920	 And then right.
03:23:20.920	 And then you go right.
03:23:25.920	 I wasn't going right.
03:23:29.920	 And then you go right.
03:23:33.920	 And then you go right.
03:23:37.920	 And then you go right.
03:23:42.920	 And then you go right.
03:23:51.920	 Why is this one guy so impressive at your book?
03:23:56.920	 Really fun.
03:24:30.000	 the
03:24:40.180	 okay so he's like so tight
03:24:43.420	 this here
03:24:46.180	 way easier make that I thought it would be
03:24:51.520	 I'm gonna wait here and see how he does
03:24:56.360	 the back
03:25:01.360	 I want to see him do this
03:25:03.600	 so I don't remember his movement in like this area I want to see something
03:25:15.680	 fuck
03:25:19.520	 I screwed God
03:25:26.360	 so
03:25:39.320	 there's no more lap right
03:25:41.520	 so I got another chance
03:25:46.520	 now our characters is safe
03:25:50.080	 right here
03:25:53.000	 let me see what you're doing
03:25:56.200	 I'm gonna see what you're doing
03:26:00.000	 to
03:26:07.000	 jump out that any drift
03:26:10.000	 maybe catching that as hard
03:26:13.000	 maybe you have to carry like a ton of speed
03:26:16.000	 it seems like it kind of wants it you just like fall off a little bit
03:26:29.000	 I'll try to angle it tighter
03:26:36.000	 it seems like he could
03:26:39.000	 to see red boost here you think
03:26:46.000	 it doesn't seem like he could
03:26:54.000	 there's no way charge jumps
03:27:04.000	 maybe
03:27:11.000	 maybe
03:27:17.000	 maybe charge jump maybe just like a backwards jump instead of jumping into the wall
03:27:20.000	 just to get it a little more
03:27:27.000	 no no no he's not mushroom
03:27:33.000	 maybe see a charge jump
03:27:40.000	 the only thing is if he's charged jumping like I would notice it if I watched the clip
03:27:44.000	 because you see how the charge jump you have to do like a little hop there
03:27:48.000	 maybe
03:27:52.000	 I'm gonna watch
03:27:54.000	 instead of just dick around
03:27:58.000	 I want to see you on the time
03:28:00.000	 you can read boost there with soft drifting I think he's read boosting I think he
03:28:16.360	 read boosts and then like keeps the drift up the ramp and then like gets red and
03:28:21.080	 then lets it rip and then he gets a little bit more to make it.
03:28:40.800	 The problem is that we're not going to see it on this lap and this head doesn't have
03:28:44.920	 much execution. It's super easy.
03:29:14.920	 All right right here. Keep charging on 100% that's what he's doing.
03:29:44.920	 Let's see him do it again. He likes to go with the boost like so early to get the
03:29:52.960	 charge down ready. He doesn't go nearly as far as I thought he would and he doesn't
03:29:56.560	 even really angle it.
03:30:00.000	 I would think to get more height you want to like angle it up more but I guess you just
03:30:17.160	 killed too much of your speed.
03:30:19.920	 Let's try it again.
03:30:22.280	 Also just doing that section cleaner might keep more speed and make it like possible.
03:30:29.000	 That also might be the problem.
03:30:42.440	 At least the beginning is pretty useful for me now.
03:30:46.440	 I think it's going to take me a while before I get consistent with this.
03:30:58.960	 I gotta stop doing that air trick.
03:31:05.960	 Let's go back.
03:31:06.960	 Oh back.
03:31:15.960	 Clear it, clear it.
03:31:17.960	 Tight.
03:31:21.960	 That was close though.
03:31:27.960	 I can get the charge jump, don't let me know.
03:31:49.960	 I think we're going to the end of that.
03:32:00.000	 and
03:32:15.940	 does anyone know what direction he does the charge him like does he go backwards or does he go forwards
03:32:21.380	 or
03:32:22.860	 be curious he's hard for me to tell
03:32:26.860	 the
03:32:29.860	 track forwards
03:32:31.860	 forward seemed like it was
03:32:33.860	 really close
03:32:39.860	 I remember the guy from Shaddy said that they
03:32:41.860	 were running this that this jump is a lot harder to
03:32:45.860	 the
03:33:12.860	 see if that would matter. I can do that.
03:33:19.860	 I forget how he even does this area, you know.
03:33:22.860	 Like how he does.
03:33:25.860	 Doesn't do this.
03:33:33.860	 Man, that's so cool.
03:33:42.860	 I don't know.
03:33:49.860	 Wait, how the fuck does he trick? Does he do it charge to you?
03:33:59.860	 Yeah.
03:34:00.000	 to see does
03:34:02.000	 here
03:34:04.000	 we're gonna bumble away
03:34:07.000	 trying to trick and it's not worth it
03:34:12.000	 I'm gonna try to trick and it's not worth it
03:34:16.000	 I'm gonna try to trick and it's not worth it
03:34:20.000	 fuck
03:34:22.000	 my coins dude
03:34:24.000	 that's it
03:34:26.000	 I mean
03:34:34.000	 I meant to grab that
03:34:53.000	 like this
03:34:55.000	 just right there but not quite
03:35:05.520	 the angles got to be pretty fucking specific I guess
03:35:16.000	 because he's tighter
03:35:25.000	 and I remember him going a lot shallower than I thought he would
03:35:32.000	 but it's not like he bumps or anything
03:35:37.000	 hey what's up midway
03:35:41.000	 this is tricky
03:36:00.000	 two eyes
03:36:08.280	 You think the coins really matter?
03:36:19.960	 Like for this jump to succeed, I mean obviously they matter in the context of the man
03:36:24.560	 I'll try backflip
03:36:39.560	 I'm wondering if like this setup like you need to maintain your speed like super well
03:36:54.560	 I thought that might actually work.
03:37:24.560	 Like maybe I do a backflip and then I hold like right or something like there might be like I might have to flip directions really fast
03:37:42.560	 I'm just kind of experimenting
03:37:54.560	 Does anyone in chat have experience with this?
03:38:00.000	 know how to do this. Hold left on wall, alright.
03:38:18.640	 Wait, I forgot to...
03:38:20.640	 How much time does this save over the other way?
03:38:29.600	 0.0 seconds.
03:38:43.840	 Wait did you save hold left on wall or hold right on wall?
03:38:55.120	 Left got it.
03:39:04.840	 Thanks.
03:39:08.840	 This is probably the type of thing that I shouldn't be practicing because I'm trying
03:39:32.760	 to learn stuff that'll help me go faster in regular races and I would have to imagine
03:39:37.560	 that unless this is way fast in the other way.
03:40:00.000	 to
03:40:07.000	 come into it closer to the wall
03:40:09.000	 charge them as late as possible against the wall and hold right
03:40:30.000	 the
03:40:33.000	 sounds like
03:40:37.000	 sounds like this guy
03:40:39.000	 charge them as late as possible against the wall so that's like insanely tight
03:40:43.000	 I don't know if I'm going like full speed I'm gonna be able to get that type to wall
03:40:49.000	 where I'm hugging it
03:40:51.000	 but I could definitely get a tighter than I'm getting it right now
03:40:56.000	 but charge jumping later
03:40:59.000	 sounds interesting the problem is I'm already charged jumping pretty late because like a lot of the time when I was doing it before
03:41:05.000	 I would charge a jump and like I wouldn't even get it off which is like
03:41:09.000	 you know that's like going too late
03:41:13.000	 and then you're saying hold right when I'm up
03:41:16.000	 when I'm going up the wall which is the opposite of what that other guy said
03:41:19.000	 I'll experiment
03:41:27.000	 his angle was shallow
03:41:30.000	 like
03:41:31.000	 I'm probably jumping
03:41:33.000	 at two like aggressive of an angle
03:41:37.000	 like jumping it even more aggressive I feel like it's a mistake because I know his angle's shallow
03:41:42.000	 I know it
03:41:44.000	 I remember thinking that clearly when we were watching him
03:41:48.000	 and he was closer to the wall
03:42:30.000	 That's shallow.
03:42:31.000	 Like maybe if I just don't take the...
03:42:34.000	 You know...
03:42:36.000	 Let's get up now.
03:42:39.000	 I'll go back.
03:42:45.000	 Oh god.
03:42:54.000	 It seems like it's so close.
03:42:59.000	 I don't know.
03:43:12.000	 I jump wrong this time.
03:43:14.000	 I was too wide.
03:43:30.000	 I think that's like how I want to do it though.
03:43:33.000	 It's easier to make like all these lines work when...
03:43:37.000	 I do these jumps correctly.
03:43:48.000	 First lap no coins.
03:43:53.000	 Yeah.
03:43:54.000	 I don't know if the coins are necessary but they might make it easier.
03:44:00.000	 and
03:44:07.440	 all get points
03:44:09.840	 right now go through another
03:44:40.840	 I actually mushroomed.
03:44:44.840	 Oops.
03:44:47.840	 This is due to the second.
03:44:59.840	 Man, I feel less comfortable doing that.
03:45:03.840	 He took my coins, dude.
03:45:07.840	 I'm doing it all alone.
03:45:10.840	 I'm not sure if I can get it.
03:45:18.840	 Down trick. Got it.
03:45:36.840	 Oh, it's not like make it.
03:45:40.840	 I'm more worried about the other cards right now.
03:46:00.000	 I have no mushrooms he took my shit.
03:46:07.000	 It's messed up.
03:46:16.000	 That was an early trick.
03:46:18.000	 I need to get better doing this when I'm not at the start.
03:46:23.000	 I'm really angry.
03:46:28.000	 I'm really angry.
03:46:33.000	 I'm really angry.
03:46:37.000	 Wow, okay, so it's different every time.
03:46:40.000	 They still have how many coins you have.
03:46:42.000	 Are you shooting me?
03:46:53.000	 Yeah, I know they matter, obviously.
03:46:58.000	 It's just like a lot of the time it doesn't completely fuck up tricks.
03:47:06.000	 I gotta see the way he takes it on the second third lap.
03:47:22.000	 I think I take it too tight and then all of a sudden, lack of too much pissed off.
03:47:37.000	 I'm really angry.
03:47:44.000	 I'm really angry.
03:47:51.000	 I'm really angry.
03:48:00.000	 I can get this.
03:48:13.000	 Two layers on the charge.
03:48:16.000	 I keep jumping so stupidly there.
03:48:34.000	 I don't remember that shit.
03:49:34.000	 It's a matter of a little bit.
03:49:56.000	 Now he doesn't have the rebust, he charge boosts, but he doesn't.
03:50:00.000	 He doesn't hold charge boost enough to get it run. He's like barely charges with it.
03:50:06.560	 Honestly yeah, I
03:50:11.520	 charge it away too early.
03:50:22.800	 This is too wild.
03:50:24.800	 Tricking, man.
03:50:54.800	 You gotta get a root now in your front tooth.
03:50:59.560	 I broke it on cereal.
03:51:01.920	 How the fuck did you break it on cereal?
03:51:03.360	 Did you like jump down on the spoon?
03:51:09.960	 I did that when I was really young.
03:51:13.800	 I like jump down on a fork when I was eating a cinnamon roll.
03:51:17.120	 I don't know why I was eating it.
03:51:18.400	 I never eat cinnamon rolls with forks anymore.
03:51:24.800	 I'm not gonna do that.
03:51:47.360	 Taking on my wisdom teeth hurt a lot.
03:51:49.880	 But that's because I got my wisdom teeth taken out because I was getting headaches.
03:51:53.680	 They're like, well, I might fix your headaches.
03:51:59.720	 I was getting...
03:52:00.000	 getting headaches because I had tension migraines, which were because my jaw hurt.
03:52:05.500	 Guess what makes your jaw hurt?
03:52:06.900	 Getting your wisdom teeth taken out.
03:52:09.100	 I had the worst fucking headaches.
03:52:12.700	 After I got those wisdom teeth taken out.
03:52:17.100	 So it didn't really help me.
03:52:18.700	 Also back then, I got prescribed 30 bold tablets of bike at it.
03:52:31.000	 But my headaches were so bad.
03:52:33.000	 I actually needed to bike it in.
03:52:34.500	 And after I got through with the 30 tablets, I was like,
03:52:38.500	 hey, I still need this bike in because my head hurts like a bitch.
03:52:42.000	 And they were like, okay, here's 30 more.
03:52:44.500	 Yeah, exactly.
03:52:46.000	 That's how fucked everything was.
03:52:48.500	 And then they got everyone addicted on opioids.
03:52:51.000	 And then all of a sudden it's like, oh, yeah, this is a bad idea.
03:52:54.000	 And everyone's already fucking addicted.
03:52:56.000	 Whoever issued all that shit is a fucking moron.
03:52:59.500	 Or, which is much more likely, extremely corrupt.
03:53:06.500	 Lucky motherfucker.
03:53:17.000	 So to plan it, thanks for the sub.
03:53:25.500	 Yeah, I'm gonna watch it again.
03:53:28.500	 But like, I feel like some of the ones that was doing was kind of close.
03:53:33.500	 It's just tough.
03:53:35.000	 It's one of those tricks where I feel like I'm just not going to get it
03:53:37.500	 until I randomly completed it.
03:53:39.500	 And then hopefully it clicks a little bit.
03:53:43.500	 And I can build on it.
03:53:47.500	 We're gonna watch his second lap.
03:53:49.500	 He goes in. I swear, dude, I remember watching this and thinking he goes in shallow.
03:53:52.500	 But maybe the reason he's going in shallow.
03:53:54.500	 Like, I mean, his jump is really shallow, but he still makes it up.
03:53:58.500	 Maybe the reason he's going in shallow.
03:54:00.000	 It's just because technically if you do complete the trick it's faster not that it's making it easier
03:54:04.100	 He just knows you can get away with it cuz he's got it like locked down
03:54:07.380	 Oh, he jumped okay. This part's pretty forgiving. He charged jumps there
03:54:36.540	 Which is kind of cool
03:54:39.860	 I want to see how he does this part right here. So he tricks on the ramp. He does a late late
03:54:57.740	 I guess my angle just sucks to ask when I do that
03:55:00.540	 I don't even know if it's about the coins
03:55:04.160	 Am I just because the angles so terrible when I'm taking
03:55:09.420	 See look at how fucking shallow that is and he still gets up there. He's got seven points
03:55:15.820	 He'd let's go with his drift way earlier than I do
03:55:24.420	 I'm probably gonna end soon
03:55:30.540	 But I'd like to hit this one
03:55:51.140	 What arrow did he jump off like the second from the right
03:55:54.780	 And then he jumped into like
03:56:00.000	 a rectangular sign on the wall.
03:56:05.000	 He always jumps on the right wheel at the beginning.
03:56:10.640	 Dude, I don't even know how to make it land on a specific wheel.
03:56:15.560	 It just works or it doesn't.
03:56:21.760	 Picking up to 7th point on the ramp might help.
03:56:24.360	 There's no way that's the solution.
03:56:27.640	 Even if that worked, that'd be like some placebo shit.
03:56:29.880	 I'd be like the 7th coin.
03:56:31.680	 Oh my god.
03:56:32.840	 There's no way.
03:56:33.840	 There's no way.
03:56:36.840	 I'm trying to backflip.
03:56:38.720	 That's what I try to do.
03:56:50.720	 I know how to neutral jump on rails.
03:56:52.560	 You just shake the controller.
03:56:54.520	 Shake it in a controller's fucking stupid.
03:56:59.880	 Pick it up the coin gives you a slight speed boost after picking it up.
03:57:03.640	 I didn't actually know that was true.
03:57:08.800	 If that is true, I appreciate that bit of knowledge.
03:57:14.240	 I still need to hit it on the third lap.
03:57:19.760	 Somehow he's doing it without the coin.
03:57:25.880	 He releases so fast.
03:57:30.200	 He does get the coin.
03:57:41.560	 But when the coin's gone, I want to see what his leg.
03:57:45.840	 He goes straight down, straight down, he curves.
03:57:49.320	 Okay.
03:57:50.320	 Straight on the first one and then he curves in a bit and he's so pretty.
03:58:00.000	 He's like the second arrow and he hits like the D in danger.
03:58:18.000	 And somehow that fucking works for him because he's a beast.
03:58:21.160	 Baby's got that mini boost.
03:58:22.480	 I'm playing Peach.
03:58:23.880	 I don't think they're supposed to have different stats.
03:58:26.440	 We've been through this on Whistletop where it's like,
03:58:31.440	 Oh my god, you have to play Daisy.
03:58:33.440	 It's a Daisy issue.
03:58:35.440	 I'm gonna shoot on Daisy.
03:58:36.440	 It's not Daisy.
03:58:37.440	 It's me.
03:58:39.440	 Do you know, come on.
03:58:41.440	 How are you so...
03:58:42.440	 Rest?
03:58:43.440	 Yeah.
03:58:44.440	 Yeah.
03:58:53.440	 Do you know, I can't shake the controller when you've said not it.
03:58:55.440	 I'm gonna like slap you in the face.
03:58:57.440	 I should.
03:59:00.440	 I should.
03:59:13.440	 Now she's just licking my hand.
03:59:15.440	 I don't think I won right enough.
03:59:20.440	 Wow, I went over it.
03:59:30.440	 I don't know if that landed or not.
03:59:37.440	 Someone said, Baby Peach, the bat, something, something all of the same stats.
03:59:45.440	 Yeah, we've tried to tell them this.
03:59:49.440	 But then they start going on these crazy tangents like, yeah, but hidden stats.
03:59:53.440	 Hidden stats.
03:59:55.440	 Hidden stats.
03:59:57.440	 Hidden stats.
03:59:58.440	 Can't tell me hidden stats.
03:59:59.440	 It's like, well, what...
04:00:00.000	 are the hidden stats.
04:00:02.920	 I was too shallow.
04:00:04.880	 And they're like, I don't know,
04:00:05.640	 because they're hidden.
04:00:06.880	 They're hidden stats.
04:00:08.280	 Who's to say?
04:00:10.920	 No one knows.
04:00:22.040	 The D in danger.
04:00:24.560	 Sucks at this game got so sweaty, so fast.
04:00:27.880	 This is not
04:00:30.160	 a normal experience.
04:00:31.960	 Also, like, no one,
04:00:33.880	 if you're playing Mario Kart,
04:00:35.080	 you don't have to time trial
04:00:36.400	 where you stay in,
04:00:37.320	 and just play an absolute fucking idiot.
04:00:56.120	 I feel like I'm close.
04:00:58.480	 Because I'm on the arrow.
04:01:00.720	 I must just be like,
04:01:05.200	 I think I'm like charge jump in 2
04:01:07.200	 or earlier something.
04:01:16.640	 Do you know, it's seriously like rubbing your head
04:01:18.880	 against the mic.
04:01:21.600	 I'm loving you.
04:01:30.000	 I'm gonna stick on this for a while until...
04:01:45.720	 I can...
04:01:53.280	 You're sure, hold left.
04:01:56.240	 Random chatter that I trust.
04:02:00.000	 for no reason implicitly
04:02:05.000	 your sure hold left
04:02:10.000	 right here
04:02:13.000	 hold left there when I'm on the wall
04:02:16.000	 you're sure all right I'm pretty sure that's a different guy than before but we're gonna assume that they both know what they're talking about
04:02:30.000	 the
04:02:37.000	 it's the angle you are starting as wrong
04:02:45.000	 it's got to be pretty close though
04:02:49.000	 that one I'm like
04:02:54.000	 I'm too far away from the wall and I start lining up on him
04:02:58.000	 and it'd be closer
04:03:10.000	 whenever be easier if I take that turn
04:03:24.000	 I
04:03:31.000	 I
04:03:39.000	 wait
04:03:42.000	 I can still cut in this wall super tight maybe I take it wide and then I have more time to set up but I'm worried that I actually need this being from the drip
04:03:53.000	 and I'm not sure if I can get a drip
04:03:55.000	 many turbo or whatever the fuck do you want to call it
04:04:00.000	 I'll still only have one coin, I don't know if that matters again.
04:04:13.000	 You think that this is that matter?
04:04:21.000	 Seven point is real.
04:04:31.000	 God damn, that feels closed to me.
04:04:36.000	 You've done it with zero, I trust that guy, because it's his first message.
04:04:41.000	 Hey, do with the dark blue name that I can't read that it was your first message.
04:04:46.000	 What the fuck is wrong with the single?
04:04:51.000	 Do I need to aim it more at the wall?
04:05:00.000	 I don't know if I can read it.
04:05:04.000	 I don't know if I can read it.
04:05:09.000	 I don't know if I can read it.
04:05:13.000	 I don't know if I can read it.
04:05:17.000	 He aims for the middle of the danger sign.
04:05:30.000	 I don't know if I can read it.
04:05:40.000	 This show is easier in Tony Hawk.
04:05:44.000	 I don't know man, Tony Hawk's pretty brutal.
04:05:48.000	 There was a couple of things in Tony Hawk.
04:05:52.000	 The hardest thing in Tony Hawk is when you're on 300 combo and the blind meter is insanely fast.
04:05:58.000	 So you basically just have to...
04:06:00.000	 to like hop everywhere.
04:06:03.320	 Because you cannot let that thing move on its own for longer than like a 10th of a second.
04:06:09.200	 I know I'm doing it wrong. I can't figure out how to adjust exactly. I want to adjust.
04:06:30.720	 I want to adjust somehow.
04:06:36.320	 I know it's wrong.
04:06:38.320	 I'm just adjusted already. I'm trying. I'm so hungry Chad. I really
04:07:06.200	 was planning on ending like 30 minutes ago. But who's ever dumb as it's
04:07:11.320	 told me to speed around this stage.
04:07:16.120	 Trick me.
04:07:22.040	 Why couldn't this have just been the fucking Bumblebee warrior stage man? That's
04:07:26.200	 dangerous so chill. Now I'm doing some stupid fucking whistle jump shit. Have you seen
04:07:35.400	 me insane penguin level? No I don't even know what you're talking about. It's like whistle jump.
04:07:40.840	 Whistle top whistle jump whatever.
04:07:50.840	 It's gonna say I lose in like five seconds. I don't know exactly when it forces me
04:07:56.120	 out of the stage. It's like throw you suck.
04:08:00.000	 and
04:08:02.000	 that's supposed to practice
04:08:18.000	 that was wrong
04:08:21.000	 and
04:08:28.000	 can't believe I'm a little wide
04:08:30.000	 you
04:08:34.000	 do
04:08:39.000	 that look good to me
04:08:41.000	 second arrow middle of danger sign I charge them super late
04:08:45.000	 to back jump held left didn't want to work it's tight man
04:08:51.000	 really really tight
04:08:55.000	 I was going to get it right there that was good line up
04:08:59.000	 hold back not left I've heard from three separate shatters to hold three separate directions
04:09:07.000	 I'm getting the feeling that none of you know what the hell you're talking about
04:09:12.000	 I'm going to keep holding left
04:09:19.000	 because I'm going to trust the first chatter
04:09:24.000	 do you know it doesn't like when I do emotion tricks
04:09:32.000	 that's the last one
04:10:00.000	 I
04:10:04.420	 God
04:10:06.420	 Dammit
04:10:17.040	 Cornography tier list when I don't know probably never I do another was a thing
04:10:30.920	 This is gonna be one of those stupid tricks where I feel like I did it exactly the same as always and then it just ran on the word
04:10:38.320	 Those are the stupidest fucking tricks
04:10:45.800	 Why not try with seven because someone in chat said they did it was zero
04:10:51.280	 If someone in chat can do it was zero
04:10:54.280	 I'm greedy if I have one I shouldn't even be doing it with one
04:11:00.000	 I
04:11:17.920	 Do
04:11:19.920	 It just seems like it should work some of these look like like what do we know for a fact?
04:11:27.680	 He's doing it on the second arrow
04:11:30.160	 He's emigrated the middle of the danger sign
04:11:33.800	 What the fuck what what is that that's second arrow middle of the fucking danger sign and it just doesn't work
04:11:42.840	 I fucking hate this trick
04:11:45.720	 Baby issue
04:11:47.720	 What is this man holding when he goes up this wall
04:12:00.000	 I'm trying to hold right now just out of sheer desperation and it's also not working so I'm going back to left.
04:12:10.000	 God, it's- why the fuck did they not put the railing like a centimeter lower? Just a pixel.
04:12:21.000	 Someone clipp it if they're not being lazy like me.
04:12:46.000	 That's how I just jumped the right direction. Maybe I'm like charge jumping off the ramp too early so I have slightly less height.
04:13:11.000	 Well record, hold her in your chats as you eat at least five coins. The world record holder doesn't speak English.
04:13:39.000	 That's the closest I've ever done. That had to have been close. That was so weird.
04:14:00.000	 That was also weird.
04:14:27.960	 These are in illusion.
04:14:28.960	 They don't even fucking do anything.
04:14:31.240	 They just omit the cards.
04:14:32.240	 You guys are just dumb.
04:14:35.880	 And I'm even more dumb for believing you.
04:14:42.040	 Stop rewinding so far.
04:14:43.160	 The problem is I'm so paranoid that I need this exact amount of momentum that I'm just
04:14:47.960	 doing this every time.
04:14:49.200	 I can't risk it.
04:14:57.960	 Look at how close I am every fucking time now.
04:15:01.160	 I just can't why you get there.
04:15:04.920	 If coins are useless, why do you get them on whistle top?
04:15:07.000	 Because Tyler does.
04:15:09.840	 If this guy's name was Tyler, I would get the coins.
04:15:17.080	 Turn a harder into rail at the top.
04:15:19.600	 Does that matter?
04:15:21.400	 Do I have to turn into it at the top?
04:15:23.880	 Is that seriously what I've been doing?
04:15:25.080	 Rolls is full time.
04:15:33.640	 So I go left, left, left, left, and then right.
04:15:37.840	 When I hit the rail.
04:16:00.000	 the
04:16:02.000	 the
04:16:07.000	 you know eventually I'm just gonna randomly hit it and it's gonna look exactly the same and I'm still
04:16:12.000	 not gonna be able to figure out what the fuck I did differently
04:16:15.000	 you know that's coming right
04:16:30.000	 shake the controller
04:16:32.000	 that's just gonna make me trick I don't want to trick
04:16:37.000	 use a mushroom that makes you go fast
04:17:00.000	 all right fine I'm gonna get the fucking coins
04:17:07.000	 all right maybe they do matter
04:17:10.000	 from as I can do this now
04:17:29.000	 I'm just stuck up
04:17:33.000	 after I have coins I don't know how to do it
04:17:36.000	 and I only have like 45 seconds left because I'm in the dick it around
04:17:40.000	 so long
04:17:53.000	 I actually use a much more
04:17:56.000	 oops
04:18:00.000	 ,
04:18:05.000	 ,
04:18:14.000	 ,
04:18:20.000	 the
04:18:41.520	 the
04:19:05.580	 God forbid an old dog on suspend you guys are so
04:19:09.580	 So obviously on Juno's like like Juno can do no wrong
04:19:20.020	 She was eating squeakers and you guys are like oh wow oh God forbid Juno as a hobby
04:19:26.420	 You just have to hate on her all the time
04:19:39.580	 That's only the plus 11 dude. I'm kind of cooking
04:20:00.000	 the
04:20:06.000	 fuck I screwed up
04:20:15.000	 you need the 7th point I'm gonna get it
04:20:17.000	 the
04:20:23.540	 right here
04:20:25.740	 first try
04:20:27.540	 god damn it
04:20:29.780	 I don't fuck with Mike's hard lemonade
04:20:37.520	 almost said mark
04:20:39.020	 the
04:20:46.020	 I drink
04:20:48.020	 diet cranberry mixed lemonade almost exclusively
04:20:54.020	 I drink huge amounts of it
04:21:04.020	 It's almost like they do nothing
04:21:21.020	 That delclosed dude. I felt a little bit of the rumble in the controller from that rail
04:21:29.020	 That's got to mean something
04:21:35.020	 That's the coin difference
04:21:41.020	 I didn't feel that sign
04:21:46.020	 Land a little more to the left of the sign after jumping
04:21:50.020	 Aim for it slightly above what the hell does that mean
04:21:58.020	 Once that
04:22:00.000	 Once my ankle's chosen, I do a back jump and I can't really affect it that much.
04:22:04.040	 I just hold left.
04:22:06.040	 I'm not like adjusting it after I've done the jump.
04:22:09.400	 I don't know how to aim it so I can go above the sign, but I could try and aim it more to the left of the sign.
04:22:15.600	 That I can do.
04:22:17.400	 The problem is it felt like he was in the middle of the danger sign.
04:22:21.200	 Maybe it's more to the left of the danger sign.
04:22:26.600	 We'll not to the left of the danger sign, but maybe like the D and danger.
04:22:29.800	 I think I remember saying that.
04:22:39.200	 You need to go up more than left.
04:22:41.000	 Well how the fuck do I do that though?
04:22:56.400	 You need to release the charge jump earlier.
04:22:58.200	 I thought it was I need to release it later.
04:23:00.800	 I could try earlier.
04:23:11.800	 That was a good attempt.
04:23:13.200	 Best one yet, honestly.
04:23:14.800	 I'm confused what did I do.
04:23:17.600	 That guy seemed like he was impressed.
04:23:22.200	 I can't tell if he's throwing me or not.
04:23:28.200	 You aim at the G every time.
04:23:32.800	 He hits above D.
04:24:00.000	 that was like the deed have a book to get higher on the sign though is the is the
04:24:08.040	 question that I have like I think my spots correct maybe I'm charged jumping like
04:24:14.720	 slightly too how do I get more height there
04:24:22.560	 world records holding right not left how do you know
04:24:32.000	 you need to eat
04:24:33.640	 that was an even close what's the fuck
04:24:42.080	 you guys told me to hit the deed so I'm trying to hit the deed
04:24:56.160	 his drift is way tighter on the corner
04:25:07.040	 but it's hard to get that really tight because then you need to
04:25:12.400	 bond I don't think it needs to be perfectly tight I think the charge jump super
04:25:20.000	 important I think the charge jump is extremely specific
04:25:37.040	 because I want them a men would be correct like if I go all the for some reason
04:25:41.000	 the momentum gets kind of like bucked up what I rewind like I lose a bunch of
04:25:44.760	 my speed if I go from back here I keep all my speed every time so it makes
04:25:49.720	 these jumps really clean so I clear them I think might matter might not do that
04:25:57.800	 felt close
04:26:00.000	 That felt seriously close.
04:26:06.400	 What do you mean no?
04:26:22.000	 Plant I am World Record Holder and Great.
04:26:26.080	 Can someone clip him
04:26:28.480	 Doing it so I can watch it like in slow motion
04:26:41.680	 No, it's an image also you only link fucking garbage. I need a clip
04:26:51.120	 It's on YouTube. I don't trust him. I don't trust him
04:26:57.520	 I don't need trust the chatter
04:27:01.280	 It's literally a clip. I don't trust him. Someone else links something else
04:27:14.080	 All right, actually
04:27:20.800	 I clicked on Jfunk gaming's link
04:27:24.480	 I trust Jfunk
04:27:27.520	 I don't trust him.
04:27:57.520	 I don't trust him.
04:28:30.000	 Okay.
04:29:00.000	 I still have no idea what he holds.
04:29:25.320	 I should probably show this on stream.
04:29:32.320	 But it's annoying, changing sources and stuff.
04:29:34.960	 He holds 8 coins.
04:29:36.440	 Yeah, I looked clearly at the video and he holds 8 coins.
04:29:42.240	 I'm positive.
04:29:47.720	 Also he plays Daisy.
04:29:52.320	 Dude, it's insane.
04:29:53.720	 I just watch the video and it's crazy how close I am doing this to how he's doing it.
04:30:00.000	 He like barely goes over the line. He goes on the right side of this thing and he lands up up like the A in the end and danger
04:30:07.240	 Which is exactly what I did and I fucking failed it. He's so close
04:30:15.080	 It's insane how specific this is use of mushroom. No, I'm not using the mushroom
04:30:26.360	 God, it's the hidden Daisy stretch
04:30:30.080	 It's gotta be like do that angle hand to be like the the first thing I did not though last one the last one
04:30:35.320	 It did suck
04:30:41.720	 He does get more height. It has to be like
04:30:45.120	 When I charge up it has to be like the charge jump timing
04:30:50.920	 Like I'm either doing it like way too early
04:30:54.520	 Hold on hold on
04:30:56.520	 Yeah
04:30:58.920	 But then I do it later and then it feels like I don't get the jump off. It has to be that timing
04:31:06.840	 We're about to run out of time
04:31:08.840	 for it
04:31:13.560	 That was two I
04:31:15.560	 Charge them to too early too early. That's what the problem is I got a charge emulator
04:31:26.520	 Fuck we're going backwards
04:31:38.200	 Why don't you get more coins?
04:31:40.840	 You're right
04:31:43.560	 But I'm too stubborn
04:31:48.040	 That was it
04:31:50.040	 Fuck I could feel it that line was perfect
04:31:53.720	 This is a top 10 guy explaining it. I am not clicking that shit
04:32:00.000	 I'm not cooking it.
04:32:13.720	 You just post-Visci-lookin' links.
04:32:30.000	 Dude, imagine if I somehow figured this shit out?
04:32:40.000	 Oh, nevermind.
04:32:43.840	 I was like, that could be the P-B.
04:32:53.840	 Oh, I need to have a different method to do on this.
04:33:13.800	 I need a cut like way harder after the first drama.
04:33:20.800	 A big cut.
04:33:30.800	 That's good.
04:33:32.800	 That's really good.
04:33:34.800	 Oh, dude, come on.
04:33:36.800	 Now he's gonna take a fucking coin and restart.
04:33:41.800	 It's not that you posted too much stuff that like trick me and now I don't trust the stuff that you post anymore.
04:33:48.800	 Even though today you've been truthful.
04:34:00.000	 getting better
04:34:22.760	 after I get in a lot of this because I have to do so much because I can have to student
04:34:26.260	 fucking jump. I'll send on discord. Is it he's gonna send me like a
04:34:37.300	 rarfile.
04:35:05.300	 way but want to be again.
04:35:12.300	 What what what the fuck?
04:35:20.300	 There we go. Okay I get a how to do it on the second map now.
04:35:35.300	 Do not redeem discord message?
04:36:00.000	 I just need to jump later and I'll get it.
04:36:09.160	 I just need to jump later with the same angle, which might be a little tricky because
04:36:14.960	 the jump is like part of what lines it up for me.
04:36:25.440	 Dude, that was close man.
04:36:41.560	 That was way off.
04:37:11.560	 Oh my god.
04:37:20.680	 The world record guy only succeeded this trick once and 15 runs.
04:37:25.000	 Dude, what the fuck am I doing here man?
04:37:33.360	 That's like if Tyler were to write something and was like, yeah bro, I hit this trick
04:37:41.280	 1 and 100 times.
04:37:42.280	 I'd be like, what the fuck am I doing?
04:37:48.880	 The damn page trick.
04:37:51.680	 He says it's way easier the very first attempt when you get the coin because you do get a boost.
04:37:57.040	 After that, he says good luck.
04:38:00.000	 Wow, that's great. That's real motivating. Let's try this again.
04:38:09.000	 Let's go around.
04:38:11.000	 Let's go around.
04:38:25.000	 Stay in DK's base port, Lord Bro. Hey, don't disrespect DK's base port. That's a good map.
04:38:32.000	 Let's go around.
04:38:40.000	 The angles, right? I just didn't have enough height. Because my jump was like...
04:38:46.000	 Too early.
04:38:50.000	 I'm not sure if DK's base port is going to be a good map.
04:38:56.000	 You see how when you charge jump, there's smoke on the wheels, and then it turns blue.
04:39:02.000	 He does it so late.
04:39:06.000	 He doesn't see the blue coming out.
04:39:11.000	 He does it the moment it charges.
04:39:14.000	 He just so happened to like pop out at the perfect time. That's how late he's doing.
04:39:29.000	 So like any time I'm on this ramp and you see that blue stuff coming out.
04:39:34.000	 When I'm right about to jump, it's like I already fucked it. Probably. It seems extremely specific.
04:39:39.000	 That was better because we only saw it for like a split second, but it's got to be better.
04:39:50.000	 Got to be even further better.
04:40:00.000	 I imagine no one is seriously attempting this side and like races.
04:40:16.000	 Dude, you have to be fucking psych of the temp this summer race.
04:40:21.000	 I must see you had like, I don't know, could you use a mushroom to just do stuff here?
04:40:36.000	 That was so good and it won't work.
04:40:46.000	 Wait, wait, terrible.
04:41:17.000	 What does he hold on the wall though? He doesn't say what he holds on the wall.
04:41:23.000	 He just is good luck.
04:41:37.000	 I think we're the really.
04:41:41.000	 That will.
04:41:44.000	 I've been doing this for the last.
04:41:48.000	 I don't even know how long.
04:41:53.000	 He holds right. You can see in the replay in his front wheels.
04:41:56.000	 The chatter is said, left was a troll.
04:41:58.000	 Oh shit.
04:42:00.000	 That's actually kind of compelling.
04:42:06.500	 Dude, what if I've had tons of these work?
04:42:12.500	 But we've had 30 minutes wasted by some guy tell me,
04:42:16.000	 no hold, left and full time.
04:42:24.200	 We've been staying there for 30 minutes.
04:42:26.000	 Dude, there's people that say it.
04:42:27.500	 And then there's people that say other things.
04:42:29.000	 And then I get tricked, and then I don't get tricked.
04:42:31.500	 It's hard not to get tricked.
04:42:33.500	 I don't know who the fuck's down the truth.
04:42:38.000	 Oh my god, this is it!
04:42:39.000	 No!
04:42:40.500	 No, I thought for sure, dude, that's like the best attempt I've ever had
04:42:45.000	 and it looks exactly the same as all the other failures.
04:42:48.500	 Oh my god.
04:43:00.000	 Oh my god.
04:43:11.000	 Another good one.
04:43:13.000	 Are you sure he holds right?
04:43:15.500	 I need to look at the clip again.
04:43:17.000	 Yeah, he holds right.
04:43:20.000	 God damn it, I did get tricked.
04:43:22.000	 He holds a direction.
04:43:41.000	 The problem is I'm holding right now, and I still suck.
04:43:43.000	 So I was kind of hoping that we would get like an instant breakthrough,
04:43:46.000	 and I would be like, yeah.
04:43:49.000	 Nope.
04:43:50.000	 Still hard.
04:44:00.000	 Good one.
04:44:05.000	 Oh, I felt the rumble in my controller, dude.
04:44:13.000	 That car wanted the rail.
04:44:16.000	 It wants the rail.
04:44:18.000	 It just, just go home to the rail.
04:44:21.000	 Let's go home.
04:44:23.000	 Just go home.
04:44:24.000	 Look at it!
04:44:25.000	 Oh my god, it's so good.
04:44:27.000	 It's like exactly like with the world record dozen separate summaries and it fails.
04:44:32.000	 Just go home.
04:44:35.000	 Eradette, thanks for the sub.
04:44:37.000	 That wasn't that good.
04:44:43.000	 It looks like exactly the same, and sometimes it's just like, not the shit now.
04:44:49.000	 Because it's not slightly slightly slightly different.
04:44:55.000	 Maybe?
04:44:59.000	 Maybe?
04:45:02.000	 She needs this control.
04:45:16.000	 That was gonna be it.
04:45:25.000	 It's got a, I'm really hoping it's something that's like super small that once I fix it,
04:45:31.000	 I can actually hit this consistently.
04:45:35.000	 One thing too is...
04:45:39.000	 I'm pretty sure I would have hit it at this point if I was practicing it in my...
04:45:50.000	 Free room?
04:46:00.000	 I fucked up the drift.
04:46:10.440	 Cause the coin would be there.
04:46:11.960	 Apparently it's way easier at the coin.
04:46:14.440	 That's from the World Record holder which was translated twice.
04:46:19.520	 Some Japanese of French admit from French to English.
04:46:37.200	 I think I'm money with this.
04:46:59.520	 How do I just tell the game to put me into free room?
04:47:03.760	 What's the button?
04:47:06.040	 I want to try and free room because the coin will come back.
04:47:09.000	 I think that's how it works.
04:47:25.400	 I just sounded boomer.
04:47:27.640	 Okay.
04:47:29.800	 I don't care.
04:47:34.560	 Whoa!
04:47:35.560	 Look at that height!
04:47:36.560	 Oh my god.
04:47:37.560	 There's a weird one.
04:48:00.000	 I don't care just what a boom that would save you.
04:48:07.000	 That's good.
04:48:10.000	 That's good.
04:48:12.000	 Dude look at how much fucking hide I'm getting on these.
04:48:19.000	 I've verified the coin that would work.
04:48:22.000	 You can say it's coped but that really looks good.
04:48:31.000	 You need to get to the fence way earlier.
04:48:38.000	 The thing is I'm jumping from the same angle he's jumping from.
04:48:41.000	 I'm doing the charge jump later, which is, which is helping me slightly.
04:48:45.000	 I assume.
04:48:50.000	 It's like, it's, I'm not.
04:48:54.000	 There's something I'm missing but like if I'm doing the same angle
04:48:59.000	 and I'm holding the same direction as him.
04:49:01.000	 Like yeah, there's, it's small margins but it's not like I can do something wildly different.
04:49:06.000	 Like I have to change earlier steps in the plan.
04:49:29.000	 Because like that angle's different.
04:49:34.000	 He doesn't go quite that up.
04:49:40.000	 I think because it just doesn't want to attach.
04:49:50.000	 That I try to do something different.
04:49:58.000	 Japanese trick only.
04:50:00.000	 You got it.
04:50:09.000	 Where's FriRum? How do I FriRum? I want to FriRum so I can get the stupid coin. You need to hold left.
04:50:16.000	 Is there any way I can practice this chat where the coin actually returns?
04:50:24.000	 What it, what it work in FriRum or is it going to be different?
04:50:30.000	 You're not FriRum.
04:50:38.000	 So I get one fucking attempt on the coin and that's it.
04:50:46.000	 It's gone.
04:50:51.000	 That was horrible.
04:51:00.000	 So what's it?
04:51:19.000	 Someone said no one in the time trial discourse can get a consistently.
04:51:24.000	 My chat was saying that simply is a fucking god at this.
04:51:28.000	 Simply has to know something. He figured something out.
04:52:00.000	 but
04:52:12.480	 he even
04:52:12.600	 Nens got this
04:52:15.140	 now I don't want to hold the drift
04:52:17.860	 that's not what the guy who hits its
04:52:20.300	 did
04:52:21.360	 he like releases drift really
04:52:26.200	 really
04:52:27.100	 Oh my god
04:52:27.600	 I think, you know how like sometimes I do it,
04:52:30.000	 and it's like, huh, it really didn't go that high.
04:52:32.480	 I did it to shallow.
04:52:35.240	 I think you wanna be like right on the edge of like,
04:52:40.240	 you know, making it like,
04:52:42.760	 like if you go less shallow,
04:52:44.880	 you're gonna go much higher, right?
04:52:46.840	 And it seems like there's like a certain thing
04:52:50.840	 or whatever, that's when you go wide.
04:52:53.880	 When you go shallow, sometimes you go so shallow
04:52:56.560	 that it like doesn't really get that high.
04:52:59.680	 Like that time.
04:53:00.520	 That was so shallow, I got like no height.
04:53:02.920	 You wanna be like, as shallow as possible
04:53:06.400	 that you still get like the high one,
04:53:08.720	 but you're like cutting it in between
04:53:12.000	 and the game doesn't know,
04:53:13.360	 and then it just puts you on the rail.
04:53:15.680	 I'm pretty sure that's what's happening.
04:53:21.040	 The world record holder would agree with me.
04:53:26.800	 I think I should have done that.
04:53:38.640	 You know, I spent, I spent for ever,
04:53:41.360	 I bet I could spend another two hours doing this
04:53:43.480	 and then hit it one time,
04:53:45.480	 and then tomorrow they come up with like,
04:53:47.000	 an imagin of that work, dude,
04:53:48.840	 I would be so fuckin' pissed that worked,
04:53:51.240	 because that was so different than like, every other one.
04:54:00.000	 Still no idea what you're trying to do. The rail at the top. I'm trying to get it.
04:54:06.800	 Like right there. Yellow rail. Bounce me off.
04:54:11.840	 Yeah, someone will come up with a new strat that isn't this stupid and probably saves more time and then all the
04:54:18.560	 practice on this trick will be for nothing.
04:54:29.440	 Yeah.
04:54:35.440	 It's right there. Just get it. That's what I've been trying to tell my stupid fucking character and they won't do it.
04:54:48.560	 Getting real sick of baby peaches shit and I'm starving. I've done this an hour and 15 minutes longer than I want to do just because I am so
04:54:59.920	 autistic that I cannot stop until I hit this stupid ass trick one to time. Not even in the run. Just one time.
04:55:09.760	 One fucking time with a rewind safe state button.
04:55:13.520	 You know how like it doesn't even matter if I hit this once. I'm never going to be able to do it in the fucking run anyways.
04:55:22.160	 Oh my god. Maybe I need to hold like up and then right.
04:55:31.520	 Maybe that's the secret. Or like down and then right. He ends with right but do we know for sure he starts with right?
04:55:38.800	 I'm not convinced.
04:55:43.520	 I'm so happy that I'm in a daisy. Just the case of matters.
04:55:55.920	 Maybe the maybe it's such a small difference that it actually
04:56:00.000	 matters. What if I swapped a daisy and I just started to hit them every fucking time?
04:56:04.880	 I don't even know if that made me happy. That'd probably piss me off more than anything.
04:56:10.800	 No, it would make me happy. It would make me happy. It's not gonna happen, though.
04:56:30.080	 Why do you start with daisy in the first place? I don't really like daisy that much.
04:56:38.080	 Like as a character. I don't like the noises she makes. Dude, I'm so good at this stage.
04:56:48.160	 Just from failing this trick a million times. It's kind of funny.
04:57:00.000	 Okay, it's free that up. The reason why this like daisy is because in Mario 10 is
04:57:15.680	 their golf, I can't remember which one. It might have been Mario's strikers. She was extremely
04:57:21.920	 fucking annoying. Oops, whatever, I don't care. Oh, okay.
04:57:36.880	 That was a good jump. It's DV909. Thanks for this stuff. See, Steve likes what he's saying. He's watching this
04:57:45.360	 gameplay and he's like, I like this. I need to stop right now. I got one attempt with the coin.
04:57:52.480	 This is it. Dear God, I fucked it up.
04:58:00.000	 to
04:58:06.000	 do I charged a little bit too late
04:58:10.000	 as he sucks
04:58:16.000	 x-core v thanks for the sub
04:58:20.000	 the prom is an eighth coin isn't like a true run
04:58:26.000	 if i got it with eight coins i'm pretty sure
04:58:28.000	 people from chat would make fun of me and say that it's not real
04:58:34.000	 so it has to be done with seven
04:58:46.000	 this is good this is good oh
04:58:52.000	 maybe it's because i wasn't holding right quick enough
04:58:54.000	 maybe i need to hold right like even quicker that
04:58:58.000	 that seemed good to me
04:59:04.000	 that's good no it's not dude it really is like right on the cusp of like
04:59:10.000	 oh man it's some fucky shit that makes this trick work
04:59:24.000	 it's like in between two dimensions
04:59:30.000	 wait no three dimensions two dimensions is just
04:59:34.000	 it's in between two separate dimensions that's what i meant to say
04:59:46.000	 the angle you're going at the ramp is all wrong do it looks exactly like
04:59:52.000	 the fucky
05:00:00.000	 you just saw what I just did right you just saw that you saw that you saw the angle it's
05:00:07.600	 fresh in your mind everything's clear okay everything's clear
05:00:13.320	 well hold on a sec one sec oh my stream has some sort of issue with it one sec I'm fixing it
05:00:28.880	 it's happening I'll have it fixed shortly
05:00:35.880	 one sec don't worry don't worry
05:01:06.880	 have that fresh in your mind okay that that cliff I just did have it fresh in your mind
05:01:13.920	 what is happening here don't worry about it it's fresh in your mind right here I'm
05:01:19.280	 replaying it I'm replaying either clip look at this
05:01:23.480	 see look
05:01:29.480	 and then all of a sudden it just fucking get touches it just attaches what the
05:01:35.760	 fuck it's not way different
05:01:44.080	 he mounts the wall so much higher than you how does that height come to
05:01:48.680	 pass though like all the steps before that are so similar I'm near the
05:01:55.360	 central line I go down the right side of the second from the
05:02:00.000	 right arrow. I aim for like that part on the danger sign, but I just don't get the height.
05:02:07.200	 Just buy a little bit. It's so small. It's so small.
05:02:22.320	 It's so small. It's crazy that there's a trick like this that's this type.
05:02:30.000	 One thing that does make a huge difference, which it doesn't look like it does.
05:02:46.240	 Is when you're building up the charge job, because he doesn't have any, you see how the blue
05:02:52.240	 flame comes out, like near the back of the wheels, he basically doesn't have that come out. So like his
05:02:57.600	 jump is so tight, it's ridiculous, because it's got to be perfect. Or there's something I'm missing.
05:03:07.680	 Maybe that's just incidental. Yeah, coins and save.
05:03:17.280	 Maybe it's just carrying more speed from this turn, like just tiny bit.
05:03:29.920	 But like look, that was like, that was pretty close. It's crazy that you can get back, like
05:03:38.240	 it looks really similar, and it just doesn't want to catch, because it's got to be that
05:03:43.360	 few percent better. Like you cannot tell me that his angle or whatever was way different
05:03:52.560	 with that right there. That's so close. It's so close.
05:04:00.000	 I
05:04:01.380	 actually thought that might that might be it that was a pretty good one
05:04:29.900	 one two.
05:04:46.060	 Maybe I'll try and release drift a little bit later, but from that clip he releases
05:04:50.120	 is a pretty soon.
05:04:52.600	 I can try it though.
05:05:01.520	 I can't fucking take it any.
05:05:06.240	 Can someone take a clip of the one that I thought that I said I thought was pretty good?
05:05:11.480	 From like three ago.
05:05:16.480	 Oh, I did it.
05:05:18.680	 Oh my god.
05:05:19.840	 I can finally stop.
05:05:22.000	 I didn't know anything different.
05:05:24.240	 I didn't know anything different.
05:05:26.160	 I hit it one time out of like 10,000 tries.
05:05:29.320	 But without the coin boosts.
05:05:31.760	 That's got to count for something.
05:05:35.920	 I'm pretty sure if I did this like a hundred more times the lids off.
05:05:42.360	 All right.
05:05:43.360	 I'm hitting it like 75% of the time forever.
05:05:45.360	 I have to add.
05:05:46.360	 There is no way on earth.
05:05:48.560	 I am doing that.
05:05:50.000	 Again tonight.
05:05:51.360	 Literally zero percent sheds.
05:05:54.320	 But you know I got this shagot this trick on lock now man.
05:05:57.720	 It's done.
05:05:58.720	 It's done.
05:05:59.720	 It was the angle.
05:06:00.000	 of the ramp, it was right in between, like I was saying, it's like, you gotta go really,
05:06:06.080	 like, like, for that other jump, like, right at the beginning, you gotta do it, like, real
05:06:12.960	 steep, like, you're aimed really hard at the wall, because you just want to get to the top
05:06:17.600	 as quickly as possible. But this one, this motherfucker, it's like, if you gotta be, like,
05:06:24.720	 just, you gotta be as far fucking shallow as possible. It's insane, it's insane. I can't
05:06:32.480	 top that. I can't top that. I'm just gonna shut up at end stream. That was, that was about as
05:06:39.680	 good as it can possibly end. I'm done. Thanks for watching.
