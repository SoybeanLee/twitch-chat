1:15:03	adamdd2	Clint doesn‚Äôt fit the ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh-status extrovert‚Äù mold that modern dating culture overvalues. But he still became widely admired because: He projects authenticity Has competence in a niche And has built social capital through community Clint is proof that men can earn value later, not by flashiness, but by skill, patience, and charm.

2:51:02	ItzGalaxyyyy	you dont want air in this game so its faster
2:51:04	Diegothon	I think you need the charge jump + trick to get the height
2:51:05	Harlham	ok maybe not
2:51:06	snivyx33	yes
2:51:07	MegaMaple	Game is programmed for you to keep your speed over that jump I guess so skipping that last boost is good

3:38:45	TadpoleTrainer	is he actually even jumping? can‚Äôt you just drive up wall and transfer to rail?
3:38:46	IsraKun	It's easier on second lap because there is a coin right before the jump @clintstevens
3:38:50	44sundip_	watch the clip on YouTube, so you can go frame by frame.

3:41:18	utoddpia	wouldn‚Äôt even get it off heh
3:41:23	TonyGarret	AnimeJugs animej9Hey
3:41:23	utoddpia	makes sense
3:41:27	StupidHead	ClintStevens apparently the speed small speed boost you get from collecting the coin right before going up makes it a lot easier for lap 2 (obv coin isn't there for lap 3)
3:41:27	KingHarpo	i can't keep up with the innuendos
3:41:35	Diegothon	Why haven't you unlocked rainbow road yet Madge
3:41:38	tokarthepower	earlier jump gives you more turn radius
3:41:43	dunkacciino	He charge jumps between the the right 2 arrows
3:41:44	utoddpia	more obtuse less acute

3:43:39	Thepyrusgod	from tylers yt vid on this track
3:43:41	Thepyrusgod	it's just very precise, the charge hop timing is slightly before the tip of the ramp, and you want to do a down trick, which may help you get it if you're in the correct angle but still failing to reach the top

4:03:46	Pugsyxd	pretty sure you need the coins otherwise the other guy would just go for the trick on lap 1?
4:03:48	tokarthepower	his approach on lap 2 and 3 are different
4:03:48	rudi37_	FirstTimeChadder
4:03:50	appendix1031	it's the hidden wall ride stat
4:03:52	FabianFPS	@dPokey Real I just be making shit up and saying it like I know

4:04:05	dPokey	FabianFPS OMEGALUL
4:04:07	thechatterformerlyknownas	hold left and drift
4:04:09	Tankfird	@GalacticCrane Yeah collecting the coin gives a small boost so first time doing this is easier
4:04:11	Krohnos	easy fix just get 6 more
4:04:13	hazadeetz21	fix the angle and try doing it like a drift but on the wall (I have no idea)
4:04:14	theshy101	you just don't get it clint, you're doing it completely wrong.
4:04:14	yopememama	7th coin is real
4:04:16	AjaKars	1 coin andy Classic
4:04:16	b4skx	maybe
4:04:17	StupidHead	simply is only able to do it consistently on lap 2 atm (because of the coin)
4:04:17	istripforcake	probably
4:04:19	empty4L	yeah it does
4:04:24	ImSurfinBird	the speed from the drift may actually make it harder to get enough air before you hit the wall
4:04:25	Thepyrusgod	also im very sure you need more coins for this
4:04:26	tritexz	ClintStevens :)
4:04:26	plantsuuu	no i‚Äôve done it with 0

4:04:32	nobldominion	The ghost data doesn't go for this trick until the second lap. This must mean it's impossible

4:04:33	rudi37_	FirstTimeChadder Û†ÄÄ

5:03:08	TheNotoriousLTB	HUH
5:03:09	tegas_	The coin count is the same right?
5:03:10	futurecomp	BOOBA BOOBA BOOBA BOOBA BOOBA BOOBA
5:03:11	lttf	it does come out blue no?
5:03:11	Tier3MercySub	he starts building charge jump before you
5:03:12	yamazuki97	i think i heard simply say something like you gotta jump before the tip of the hill
5:03:13	maplesteph	have you tried a angle that's more into the wall?
5:03:15	subtleseconds	mushroom?
5:03:15	CoolOnTuesdays	mushroom was used on the wall - does that make a difference?
5:03:16	istripforcake	you're missing a coin mhm
5:03:19	Alt_Umbra	Okay I looked it up and its down to version differences, some people have the 0s7 version of the game and some have the 0s9, you can check your cartridge to see but the 0s7 version of the game is slightly higher fps and faster
5:03:19	husTlie	Lowkey maybe try more left on the sign
5:03:20	ThanDone	get the side by side OMEGALUL
5:03:20	KingHarpo	maybe not speaking english is the key
5:03:22	kaibiscus	youre tricking off the ramp he is leaving the ground before the ramp
5:03:24	quietwhen	@ClintStevens your turn is too wide and your angel is wrong
5:03:25	WeijiBeng	clint you need the double right tech

5:03:44	yillis77	Hiiiiiiigher
5:03:44	sashimiyata	angle is way different
5:03:45	SIutForMangos	get on top of the yellow part @ClintStevens
5:03:45	meltedtapioca	it was too low
5:03:46	OpanaG76	he was more sideways at the top no?
5:03:51	lttf	@alt_umbra surely he's not version locked Clueless
5:03:52	Sikodude	doing it wrong OMEGALUL
5:03:52	RoboSr	damn
5:03:53	polo__bear	japanese switch consoles have a higher wall traction stat built in @ClintStevens
5:03:53	Stamperino	the drift into middle line is tighter, you overshoot the middle line too much
5:03:54	TheNotoriousLTB	LOL
5:03:55	chewid	it was
5:03:55	LordFartamor	CLINTING
5:03:55	Pilk_	it definitely was
5:03:55	addispoon	tyler does this trick every time
5:03:56	StupidHead	just get up there
5:03:57	BubbleMePoppy	what if they‚Äôre breaking near the top PauseChamp
5:03:57	grenji	i heard the sound effect that time
5:03:57	ayylmaopp	at that point its the wall input after those last 2 jumps @ClintStevens
5:03:57	nobldominion	IT WAS PATCHED
5:03:58	davethekid	what if, you have too much speed?
5:03:58	AregularBro	quite a bit tighter on the drift
5:03:58	Lendo217	it wwas
5:03:59	IanSynth	that one looked very similar
5:03:59	ninjaskillz24	ninjaskillz24 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months!
5:03:59	Johnny3Oak	@ClintStevens heres a clip of simply hitting it https://www.twitch.tv/simply/clip/RelatedGentlePterodactylBabyRage-A568-JMfvsH8qFSb
5:04:00	Bull_run284	it was
5:04:01	PaintMang	i dont understand why hes not attaching
5:04:01	quietwhen	ok that one was
5:04:02	Throgelnor	Maybe you should rewatch it
5:04:02	AjaKars	japanese wr explained it
5:04:02	birdsnestssbm	I think he boosts around the corner later than you @ClintStevens
5:04:03	pkfiyah	it's the coin boost then right?
5:04:06	zanderwill	complaining wont help
5:04:07	CrimpBizkit1	i think you need to be 100% parallel with the pipte
5:04:07	DontRainbowReadMe	im so close GOONING
5:04:08	Cryosage_GD	bruh
5:04:08	heemf	hold AB down it helps catch the pokemon
5:04:08	UnlockedEsquire	The clip you just watched had the COIN so he probably got it to work from the boost
5:04:10	dab0na	specific point on the wall maybe?
5:04:10	lttf	hotpatched Copium
5:04:11	Stunod4	@clintstevens try flicking once you reach the top he's holding left at the top
5:04:12	Alartwo	you have to let go of the jump at the very very last moment
5:04:12	sanggyn	(Clint-san, you need 8 coins. I an WR holder) ÌÅ¥Î¶∞Ìä∏Ïî®, ÎèôÏ†ÑÏù¥ 8Ïû• ÌïÑÏöîÌï©ÎãàÎã§. Ï†ÄÎäî WR ÌôÄÎçîÏûÖÎãàÎã§. go tighter rightt
5:04:14	Alt_Umbra	Okay I looked it up and its down to version differences, some people have the 0s7 version of the game and some have the 0s9, you can check your cartridge to see but the 0s7 version of the game is slightly higher fps which results in faster movement
5:04:16	Cryosage_GD	lol
5:04:17	Yiupie	Maybe he presses a button and didnt tell anyone
5:04:20	Gnashey	has to be the coin
5:04:20	kalsvares	hes further left on the ramp
5:04:20	Kaniskion	pepeW
5:04:21	tokarthepower	i do see where he was higher
5:04:22	DoubleWinning	jump off ramp from farther left so you can land higher above the sign
5:04:23	Gnashey	it‚Äôs the coin lol
5:04:30	AjaKars	new koreanw wr!??

5:04:41	featherinthehat	i literally feel like you're gonna get it every attempt lol
5:04:42	HankSchraderRIP	ur angle off the last ramp is too far right
5:04:42	empty4L	the clip did not get the coin, it was a ghost
5:04:49	IvyClora	I CANT FUCKING TAKE IT ANYMORE
5:04:52	Gnashey	it‚Äôs definitely needs the coin pick up
5:04:53	Thepyrusgod	https://x.com/tyle_rr/status/1935738927010230599 tyler says he has a less than 50% success rate
5:04:56	Angeltam	maybe something mid-air?
5:04:57	vioie	show ghost clip again
5:05:01	gyrokinesis	you gotta hit the gray part at the top
5:05:01	dPokey	people saying get the coin, it doesnt do anything cos you do it without one on lap 3

5:05:05	snosa	OMEGALUL
5:05:08	Alt_Umbra	Okay I looked it up and its down to version differences, some people have the 0s7 version of the game and some have the 0s9, you can check your cartridge to see but the 0s7 version of the game is slightly higher fps which results in faster movement, it also depends on the switch you have
